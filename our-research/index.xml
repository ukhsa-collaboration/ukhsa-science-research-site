&lt;p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, everyone was asked to carry out protective behaviours that would prevent the spread of illness. While people had been asked to isolate in previous outbreaks, the impact of quarantining on psychological wellbeing was unclear. A [rapid review](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30460-8/fulltext) was carried out to inform the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The rapid review systematically searched scientific articles and found 24 studies that investigated the effect of quarantine on psychological wellbeing. Studies included in the review found that isolation had a significant negative impact on wellbeing, particularly for those quarantining for longer periods of time. Factors that negatively impacted wellbeing included: having a lack of supplies, resources, income, inadequate information, higher health anxiety, boredom, and stigma of having the virus.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Airborne Particulates and Brain Health</title><link>https://research.ukhsa.gov.uk/our-research/airborne-particles-brain/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 13:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://research.ukhsa.gov.uk/our-research/airborne-particles-brain/</guid><description>&lt;div class="container">

&lt;p>Increasing evidence suggests a link between air pollution and brain diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our research explores how airborne particles may impact the brain by affecting the blood brain barrier (BBB), through an interdisciplinary approach in collaboration with scientists at national facilities on the &lt;a style="color:white;" href="https://www.harwellcampus.com" target="_blank">Harwell Science and Innovation Campus.&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The hazards of staying out too long in the sun are well known – sunburn, increasing risk of skin cancer, skin ageing, to name a few. However, &lt;i>in vitro&lt;/i> laboratory research from UKHSA (and independently researched by others), shows that some sunlight activates nitric oxide, a molecule in the skin known to reduce blood pressure &lt;i>(Liu 2014)&lt;/i>. High blood pressure affects around 25&amp;percnt; of UK adults and is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease; therefore, strategies to alleviate this burden of disease are a key priority &lt;a style="color:white" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-matters-combating-high-blood-pressure/health-matters-combating-high-blood-pressure" target="_blank"> (PHE Guidance 2017).&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Antimicrobial Resistance</title><link>https://research.ukhsa.gov.uk/our-research/antimicrobial-resistance/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2024 09:24:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://research.ukhsa.gov.uk/our-research/antimicrobial-resistance/</guid><description>&lt;div class="container">

&lt;p>UKHSA uses an Open Innovation Model, which encourages the sharing of knowledge and information both internally and externally in order to solve problems. UKHSA uses this model in its Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) research to enable academics and industry to access microbiological expertise and facilities in support of early-stage drug discovery against infectious pathogens. This model enables collaborators, many of whom have no experience in microbiology, to spend time at UKHSA laboratories, where they learn microbiological techniques. This collaboration has enabled well-rounded early-stage career researchers with expertise in their primary subject (e.g., chemistry) to gain a much greater understanding and application of the microiology side to drug discovery.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Burden of Disease caused by Damp and Mould in English Housing</title><link>https://research.ukhsa.gov.uk/our-research/damp-and-mould/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 09:24:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://research.ukhsa.gov.uk/our-research/damp-and-mould/</guid><description>&lt;div class="container">

&lt;p>In England, there are around 2 million people currently living in homes with &lt;a style="color:white;" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-housing-survey-2021-to-2022-headline-report">significant damp and/or mould (3-4% of residences)&lt;/a>. While living in a damp and/or mouldy home is associated with the development or exacerbation of several respiratory diseases, conditions and symptoms, little is known about the burden of disease at a national scale in England.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Microphysiological Systems for Infectious Disease Modelling</title><link>https://research.ukhsa.gov.uk/our-research/microphysiological-systems/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Nov 2023 09:09:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://research.ukhsa.gov.uk/our-research/microphysiological-systems/</guid><description>&lt;div class="container">

&lt;p>UKHSA Scientists at the UKHSA Vaccine Development Evaluation Centre are using advanced cell culture techniques to grow human organ systems in the laboratory. These organ systems will allow vaccine, drug, and therapeutic developers to evaluate how well their products can protect humans from infectious disease before embarking on clinical trials, whilst also addressing the ethical requirement to replace or reduce the use of animals wherever possible.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>COVID-19</title><link>https://research.ukhsa.gov.uk/our-research/covid-19/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Mar 2021 12:15:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://research.ukhsa.gov.uk/our-research/covid-19/</guid><description>&lt;div class="container">

&lt;p>UKHSA has conducted over 150 research and surveillance studies, most in collaboration with academics, to better understand SARS CoV-2 virus and its transmission.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have published or submitted over 200 new research papers, commentaries and editorials on all aspects of the SARS CoV-2 virus, the illness it causes and how to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below is one of many studies contributing to the scientific knowledge base for the virus.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
