These organ systems will allow vaccine, drug, and therapeutic developers to evaluate how well their products can protect humans from infectious disease before embarking on clinical trials, whilst also addressing the ethical requirement to replace or reduce the use of animals wherever possible.
This is a step change from more traditional techniques and supports meeting UKHSA's requirements as signatory to the Concordat on Openness on Animal Research in the UK Microphysiological systems development that has been running alongside traditional screening techniques at UKHSA for several years.</description></item><item><title>COVID-19</title><link>https://research.ukhsa.gov.uk/our-research/covid-19/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Mar 2021 12:15:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://research.ukhsa.gov.uk/our-research/covid-19/</guid><description>COVID-19 UKHSA has conducted over 150 research and surveillance studies, most in collaboration with academics, to better understand SARS CoV-2 virus and its transmission.
We have published or submitted over 200 new research papers, commentaries and editorials on all aspects of the SARS CoV-2 virus, the illness it causes and how to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic.
Below is one of many studies contributing to the scientific knowledge base for the virus.</description></item></channel></rss>
