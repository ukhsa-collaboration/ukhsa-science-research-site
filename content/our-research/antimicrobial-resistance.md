description: "Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) refers to the ability of infectious microbes to develop resistance to the drugs used to treat them, making our current range of treatments increasingly ineffective. Research at UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is focussed on discovering and developing new therapies against these multidrug-resistant pathogens."

<p>UKHSA uses an Open Innovation Model, which encourages the sharing of knowledge and information both internally and externally in order to solve problems. UKHSA uses this model in its Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) research to enable academics and industry to access microbiological expertise and facilities in support of early-stage drug discovery against infectious pathogens. This model enables collaborators, many of whom have no experience in microbiology, to spend time at UKHSA laboratories, where they learn microbiological techniques. This collaboration has enabled well-rounded early-stage career researchers with expertise in their primary subject (e.g., chemistry) to gain a much greater understanding and application of the microiology side to drug discovery.</p>

<p>An understanding of chemistry, microbiology, biochemistry and other subjects is necessary for this research to be successful. Traditionally, metabolites (the end product of metabolism) and bacteriophage (viruses that selectively kill bacteria) are tested against pathogenic bacteria, fungi and viruses, to see if they could be an effective treatment. If the metabolite or bacteriophage is successful, then further testing is conducted to examine toxicity, likelihood of resistance emergence and the mechanism of action.</p>

<p>Some of this work has been supported by grants from the <a href="https://www.nihr.ac.uk/" target="_blank" style="color:white;">National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR)</a> and other external sources. We continue to develop some of our more promising antimicrobials (antiseptics, disinfectants and antibiotics) through working with a variety of partners across government and in universities. We are in discussion with external funders about using some of the models developed on the project to directly support further antimicrobial discovery and evaluation projects.</p>
