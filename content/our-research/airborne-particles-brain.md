<p>Increasing evidence suggests a link between air pollution and brain diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.</p>
<p>Our research explores how airborne particles may impact the brain by affecting the blood brain barrier (BBB), through an interdisciplinary approach in collaboration with scientists at national facilities on the <a style="color:white;" href="https://www.harwellcampus.com" target="_blank">Harwell Science and Innovation Campus.</a></p>

<p>Researchers from the UK Health Security Agency exposed blood vessel cells (as a BBB model) to diesel exhaust particles and imaged them using focussed ion beam and scanning electron microscopy combined with confocal microscopy at the <a href="https://www.clf.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/Octopus-new.aspx" target="_blank">Octopus Facility (part of the Central Laser Facility).</a></p>
<p>Analysis of three-dimensional ultrastructural images revealed interactions between particles and subcellular compartments, with nano-sized particles particularly associated with the plasma membrane. To further investigate the interactions between nano-sized particles and plasma membrane, neutron scattering experiments were performed at <a href="https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk" target =_blank>ISIS Neutron and Muon</a> to identify the effects on cellular membrane dynamics.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to gain deeper insights into how inhaled particulate matter interacts with and affects BBB function, with a specific focus on the impact to the plasma membrane.</p>
