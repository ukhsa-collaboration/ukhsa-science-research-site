        <p>
          We run an annual PhD studentship project scheme where we award funding
          to project plans put together by our researchers and academic
          partners. The scheme supports both our own staff to undertake PhDs and
          the recruitment of new students. We are not able to fund employees of
          other organisations to undertake PhDs.
        </p>

        <p>
          New students normally start around the beginning of each academic
          year. Recruitment of students generally takes place between March and
          July each year. Projects are advertised through specific academic
          partners and sometimes via FindaPhD.com. Links to any projects open
          for applications will be regularly updated on this page.
