          UKHSA recognises and endorses the Concordat to Support Research
          Integrity as published by Universities UK, and is committed to
          maintaining the highest standards of integrity in all aspects of
          research.
        </p>

        <p>
          Scientific integrity is essential for the conduct and planning of
          research, the recording and reporting of results, and the publication
          of findings. All UKHSA researchers are required to undertake their
          work with honesty, rigour, transparency and care for the subjects of
          their research. These values are central to a healthy research culture
          and ensure high quality research with results that can be trusted.

        <p>
          We support the principles of open access and open science, because we
          recognise the benefits they can bring to public health.
        </p>

        <p>
          These benefits include the ability to rapidly disseminate and provide
          a global equity of access to the outputs of research, which can aid
          evidence-based public health policy and practice, and the development
          of new research.
        </p>

        <p>
          To support these principles we have created an open access policy and
          have implemented an institutional repository, where the peer-reviewed
          outputs of research can be made open access for the benefit of public
          health and society.
