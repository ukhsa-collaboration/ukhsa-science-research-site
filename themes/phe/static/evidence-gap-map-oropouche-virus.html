        <p>Web accessibility refers to the practice of designing and developing websites and web-based applications in a
          way that makes them usable and accessible to all individuals, including those with disabilities. This includes
          ensuring that web content can be easily understood, navigated, and interacted with by people with a wide range
          of abilities and disabilities, including those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers.</p>

        <p>This Eppi Mapper generated map conforms to the World Wide Web Consortium's Web Content Accessibility
          Guidelines (<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" target="_blank">W3C WCAG</a>) Version
          2.1 Level AA to the maximum extent possible. These guidelines explain how to make web content more accessible
          for people with disabilities. The features in this map include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>If the default settings have been used when generating this map, the overall colour design has been set to
            a more visually contrasting appearance.</li>
          <li>Links in the application have been converted to buttons to accommodate screen readers.</li>
          <li>Aria status updates now inform screen readers when modals open and selected records change.</li>
          <li>Tab focus is contained within opened modals.</li>
          <li>The style selection functionality has been moved to the top menu for easier access.</li>
          <li>A new style, Textual view, has been added to the map. This view presents the record counts within each
            node in a text readable format.</li>
          <li>URL links for individual records have been made descriptive.</li>
          <li>The map generation tool will inform the user if the selected background and font colour contrast meet
            accessibility requirements.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p><b>Limitations</b></p>
        <p>At the present time, while the keyboard focus does stay within each opened modal, the focus cannot be moved
          to individual checkboxes or radio buttons or, in the View Records modal, to all fields in the full record.
          This means that those items, along with the nodes in the map, can only be selected using a mouse or pointing
          device. In future updates we hope to address this limitation.</p>

OROV fever has been registered almost exclusively in the Amazon region, but global warming, deforestation and redistribution of vectors and animal reservoirs increases the risk of Oropouche virus emergence in other areas. OROV causes a cytolytical infection in cultured cells with characteristic cytopathic effect 48h post-infection. We have studied the mechanisms of apoptosis induced by OROV in HeLa cells and found that OROV causes DNA fragmentation detectable by gel electrophoresis and by flow cytometric analysis of the Sub-G1 population at 36h post-infection. Mitochondrial release of cytochrome C and activation of caspases 9 and 3 were also detected by western blot analysis. Lack of apoptosis induced by UV-inactivated OROV reveals that virus-receptor binding is not sufficient to induce cell death. Results obtained in cells treated with chloroquine and cycloheximide indicated that viral uncoating and replication are required for apoptosis induction by OROV. Furthermore, treatment of the cells with pan-caspase inhibitor prevented OROV-induced apoptosis without affecting virus progeny production. The results show that OROV infection in vitro causes apoptosis by an intracellular pathway involving mitochondria, and activated by a mechanism dependent on viral replication and protein synthesis.

However, despite being the cause of an estimated half a million human infections since its first isolation in Trinidad in 1955, details of the molecular biology of this tripartite, negative-sense RNA virus remain limited. We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the Brazilian prototype strain of OROV, BeAn 19991, and found a number of differences compared with sequences in the database. Most notable were that the S segment contained an additional 204 nt at the 3' end and that there was a critical nucleotide mismatch at position 9 within the base-paired terminal panhandle structure of each genome segment. In addition, we obtained the complete sequence of the Trinidadian prototype strain TRVL-9760 that showed similar characteristics to the BeAn 19991 strain. By using a T7 RNA polymerase-driven minigenome system, we demonstrated that cDNA clones of the BeAn 19991 L and S segments expressed functional proteins, and also that the newly determined terminal untranslated sequences acted as functional promoters in the minigenome assay. By co-transfecting a cDNA to the viral glycoproteins, virus-like particles were generated that packaged a minigenome and were capable of infecting naive cells.

Several outbreaks of OROV in South America, especially in Brazil, have changed its status as an emerging disease, but no vaccine or specific drug target is available yet. Our approach was to identify the epitope-based vaccine candidates as well as the ligand-binding pockets through the use of immunoinformatics. In this report, we identified both T-cell and B-cell epitopes of the most antigenic OROV polyprotein with the potential to induce both humoral and cell-mediated immunity. Eighteen highly antigenic and immunogenic CD8<ovid:sup>+</ovid:sup> T-cell epitopes were identified, including three 100% conserved epitopes (TSSWGCEEY, CSMCGLIHY, and LAIDTGCLY) as the potential vaccine candidates. The selected epitopes showed 95.77% coverage for the mixed Brazilian population. The docking simulation ensured the binding interaction with high affinity. A total of five highly conserved and nontoxic linear B-cell epitopes \"NQKIDLSQL,\" \"HPLSTSQIGDRC,\" \"SHCNLEFTAITADKIMSL,\" \"PEKIPAKEGWLTFSKEHTSSW,\" and \"HHYKPTKNLPHVVPRYH\" were selected as potential vaccine candidates. The predicted eight conformational B-cell epitopes represent the accessibility for the entered virus. In the posttherapeutic strategy, ten ligand-binding pockets were identified for effective inhibitor design against emerging OROV infection. Collectively, this research provides novel candidates for epitope-based peptide vaccine design against OROV.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Adhikari Utpal Kumar; Tayebi Mourad; Rahman M Mizanur; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Binding Sites\r\nBrazil\r\n*Bunyaviridae Infections/im [Immunology]\r\n*CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/im [Immunology]\r\nCommunicable Diseases, Emerging\r\nComputer Simulation\r\nConserved Sequence/im [Immunology]\r\n*Epitope Mapping/mt [Methods]\r\nEpitopes, B-Lymphocyte/im [Immunology]\r\nEpitopes, T-Lymphocyte/im [Immunology]\r\nHumans\r\nImmunity, Cellular\r\nImmunity, Humoral\r\n*Informatics/mt [Methods]\r\nMolecular Docking Simulation\r\n*Orthobunyavirus/ph [Physiology]\r\nPolyproteins/im [Immunology]\r\n*Vaccines, Subunit/im [Immunology]\r\nViral Proteins/im [Immunology]\r\n*Viral Vaccines/im [Immunology]","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Adhikari Utpal Kumar, Tayebi Mourad, and Rahman M Mizanur (2018) Immunoinformatics Approach for Epitope-Based Peptide Vaccine Design and Active Site Prediction against Polyprotein of Emerging Oropouche Virus.

Genetic analyses of ORO-like strains from Iquitos, Peru, identified a novel reassortant containing the S and L segments of ORO virus and the M segment of a novel Simbu serogroup virus. This new pathogen, which we named Iquitos (IQT) virus, was first isolated during 1999 from a febrile patient in Iquitos, an Amazonian city in Peru. Subsequently, the virus was identified as the cause of outbreaks of \"Oropouche fever\" during 2005 and 2006 in Iquitos. In addition to the identification of 17 isolates of IQT virus between 1999 and 2006, surveys for neutralizing antibody among Iquitos residents revealed prevalence rates of 14.9% for ORO virus and 15.4% for IQT virus. Limited studies indicate that prior infection with ORO virus does not seem to protect against disease caused with the IQT virus infection. Identification of a new Orthobunyavirus human pathogen in the Amazon region of Peru highlights the need for strengthening surveillance activities and laboratory capabilities, and investigating the emergence of new pathogens in tropical regions of South America.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Aguilar Patricia V; Barrett Alan D; Saeed Mohammad F; Watts Douglas M; Russell Kevin; Guevara Carolina; Ampuero Julia S; Suarez Luis; Cespedes Manuel; Montgomery Joel M; Halsey Eric S; Kochel Tadeusz J; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAntibodies, Neutralizing/bl [Blood]\r\nAntibodies, Viral/bl [Blood]\r\n*Bunyaviridae Infections/ep [Epidemiology]\r\n*Bunyaviridae Infections/vi [Virology]\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nOrthobunyavirus/cl [Classification]\r\n*Orthobunyavirus/ge [Genetics]\r\n*Orthobunyavirus/ip [Isolation & Purification]\r\nPeru/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nRNA, Viral/ge [Genetics]\r\nReassortant Viruses/cl [Classification]\r\n*Reassortant Viruses/ge [Genetics]\r\n*Reassortant Viruses/ip [Isolation & Purification]\r\nSeroepidemiologic Studies\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Aguilar Patricia V, Barrett Alan D, Saeed Mohammad F, Watts Douglas M, Russell Kevin, Guevara Carolina, Ampuero Julia S, Suarez Luis, Cespedes Manuel, Montgomery Joel M, Halsey Eric S, and Kochel Tadeusz J (2011) Iquitos virus: a novel reassortant Orthobunyavirus associated with human illness in Peru.

OROV infection has been associated with neurological complications and OROV genomic RNA has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid from patients, suggesting its neuroinvasive potential. Motivated by these findings, neurotropism and neuropathogenesis of OROV have been investigated in vivo in murine models, which do not fully recapitulate the complexity of the human brain. Here we have used slice cultures from adult human brains to investigate whether OROV is capable of infecting mature human neural cells in a context of preserved neural connections and brain cytoarchitecture. Our results demonstrate that human neural cells can be infected ex vivo by OROV and support the production of infectious viral particles. Moreover, OROV infection led to the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and diminished cell viability 48 h post-infection, indicating that OROV triggers an inflammatory response and tissue damage. Although OROV-positive neurons were observed, microglia were the most abundant central nervous system (CNS) cell type infected by OROV, suggesting that they play an important role in the response to CNS infection by OROV in the adult human brain. Importantly, we found no OROV-infected astrocytes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first direct demonstration of OROV infection in human brain cells. Combined with previous data from murine models and case reports of OROV genome detection in cerebrospinal fluid from patients, our data shed light on OROV neuropathogenesis and help raising awareness about acute and possibly chronic consequences of OROV infection in the human brain.

The OROF causes expenses in public health, loss of labour and academic activities and social suffering. OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the outbreak of OROF in Bagazan community of San Martin Department, and comparison of the gastrointestinal and hemorrhagic clinical manifestations with those occurred in Iquitos and Brazil. METHODS: The sudden onset of an acute fever syndrome in many people of Bagazan, little village with 1082 residents, happened in may 2010. The symptoms and signs were registered in a standardized pattern. Blood samples were sent to the laboratory of the National Health Institute in Lima. RESULTS: The diagnosis was confirmed in 108 patients. The clinical manifestations were fever of 38º C, headache, muscle and joint pains, congestion of conjunctiva, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Some cases presented nose, gum and/ or vaginal bleeding. The gastrointestinal manifestations were more frequent than those of the Iquitos cases. CONCLUSIONS: The outbreak showed the dissemination of OROF to Peru, because of various favorable conditions. We discuss the hypothesis of the increase of gastrointestinal and hemorrhagic manifestations, including ecological, immunity, individual and viral characteristics.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Alvarez-Falconi; Pedro P; Ríos Ruíz; Bessy Amanda; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Arbovirus\r\nBagazan\r\nBagazán\r\nFiebre de Oropuche\r\nIquitos\r\nOropuche fever\r\nPeru\r\nPerú","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Alvarez-Falconi, Pedro P, Ríos Ruíz, and Bessy Amanda (2010) Oropuche fever outbreak in Bagazan,San Martín, Peru: epidemiological evaluation, gastrointestinal and hemorrhagic manifestations.

In Peru, laboratory etiologic identification of these infections occurs in less than 50% of cases, leading to underdiagnoses of important emerging arboviruses., AIM: To assess the prevalence of the Dengue (DENV), Oropouche (OROV), Chikungunya (CHIKV), Mayaro (MAYV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses in patients with acute febrile illness from Puerto Maldonado (Peru)., METHODOLOGY: Serum samples were obtained from patients with AFI during January 2016 to March 2016. A total of 139 specimens were analyzed for the presence of DENV, OROV, CHIKV, MAYV, and ZIKV using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)., RESULTS: CHIKV in 9.4% and OROV in 8.6% were the most prevalent arboviruses, followed by DENV and ZIKV, with a prevalence of 6.5% and 5%, respectively. Among all patients, the most common symptoms accompanying fever were headaches 79.9%, muscle pain 65.5% and joint pain 63.3%., CONCLUSIONS: During this short 3-month period, 4 arboviruses were detected by PCR, CHIKV and OROV being the most common arboviruses in Puerto Maldonado (Peru). Thus, it is crucial to include OROV detection in the national health surveillance. Furthermore, the etiologic clinical diagnosis of arboviral infections is not possible due to the low specificity of symptoms; therefore an increase of cases confirmed by molecular diagnostic methods will enhance arboviral surveillance in Peru.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Alva-Urcia Carlos; Aguilar-Luis Miguel Angel; Palomares-Reyes Carlos; Silva-Caso Wilmer; Suarez-Ognio Luis; Weilg Pablo; Manrique Carlos; Vasquez-Achaya Fernando; Del Valle Luis J; Del Valle-Mendoza Juana; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"*Arbovirus Infections/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nArbovirus Infections/vi [Virology]\r\n*Communicable Diseases, Emerging\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nDisease Outbreaks\r\nHumans\r\nPeru/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Alva-Urcia Carlos, Aguilar-Luis Miguel Angel, Palomares-Reyes Carlos, Silva-Caso Wilmer, Suarez-Ognio Luis, Weilg Pablo, Manrique Carlos, Vasquez-Achaya Fernando, Del Valle Luis J, and Del Valle-Mendoza Juana (2017) Emerging and reemerging arboviruses: A new threat in Eastern Peru.

Due to the similarity of initial clinical symptoms caused by OROV with other arboviruses found in overlapping geographical areas, differential diagnosis is challenging. As for most neglected tropical diseases, there is a shortage of reagents for diagnosing and studying OROV pathogenesis. We therefore developed and characterized mouse monoclonal antibodies and, one of them recognizes the OROV nucleocapsid in indirect immunofluorescent (IFA) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. Considering that it is the first monoclonal antibody produced for detecting OROV infections, we believe that it will be useful not only for diagnostic purposes but also for performing serological surveys and epidemiological surveillance on the dispersion and prevalence of OROV in Brazil and South America.

A total of 544 birds of 17 species were captured, being nine resident and eight migratory. Blood was collected from 350 birds for virus isolation, but no virus was isolated. Of the 95 sera in which the hemagglutination inhibition test was performed, 14.7% were reactive to alphavirus, 9.5% to flavivirus and 7.4% to bunyavirus. Of the positive reactions, 84.9% occurred in migratory birds and 15.1% i resident birds. The proportions of positive reactions to the test among migratory and resident birds were 31.5% and 18.2%, respectively, which was not statistically different (p>0.05). For alphaviruses, the species Pluvialis squatarola showed 28.6% positivity, followed by 11.8% in Arenaria interpres. For flaviviruses, only the species Sterna superciliares and Calidris pusilla were reactive to the hemagglutination inhibition test. Regarding the bunyavirus, the Arenaria interpres was 5.9% positive for the Oropouche virus. Migratory birds have proved to be important amplifiers of the arboviruses surveyed, although no viruses were isolated. Some bird species have greater amplification capacity of certain arboviruses than others. Virus isolation in wild birds is difficult, in view of the need of blood sampling in animals within the viremic period.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Araujo F A.

Several large-scale human outbreaks caused by the prototype member of this species, Oropouche virus (OROV) have been documented since the 1970s and were primarily confined to the Amazon basin. However, since 2022, more widespread OROV outbreaks have been unfolding in Brazil and across South America, with cases exported to Cuba, Italy, Spain, USA and Germany. In Brazil, the virus has reached and established communitary transmission in all geographic areas of the country. We isolated, characterized the cytopathic effect and recovered the full genome of two OROV isolates from the 2022-24 outbreak detected in patients from the Pernambuco state. Phylogenetic data supports a direct introduction from the Amazonas state, the epicenter of the epidemics in the country. As case counts accumulate in the state mounting evidence is supporting the establishiment of sustained transmission chains. Continued studies are critical to understand the transmission cycle in this region, including the most important vectors and reservoirs, to appropriately deploy control measures.

Venous blood samples, and demographic, social, and risk factor data were obtained from people age five years of age and older who lived in the village of Santa Clara on the Nanay River, a tributary of the Amazon River. Sera were tested for ORO viral antibody by an ELISA. The specificity of viral antibody reactivity was determined by a standard plaque-reduction neutralization test. Interview data were analyzed by univariate and multiple logistic regression to determine which variables were statistically associated with previous ORO viral infection, as indicated by the presence of IgG antibody. Final models were evaluated based on log-likelihood and Wald chi-square. Clustering of seropositive residents within houses was analyzed by the method of Walter. Among 1,227 persons sampled, 33.7% (n=414) were positive for ORO viral IgG antibody. Overall, antibody prevalence was similar for males (33.9%) and females (33.6%), and increased significantly with age for both sexes to include more than half of persons more than 25 years of age. The length of residence in the village was positively associated with serologic status; persons who had moved to the village within the past 15 years were less likely to be seropositive than life-long residents of the same age. Antibody prevalence among immigrants who had lived in Santa Clara more than 15 years was similar to that in life-long residents. The activity most predictive of previous ORO viral infection was travel to forest communities and travel to Iquitos. No evidence of spatial heterogeneity in ORO virus antibody distribution was observed. Results suggested that endemic transmission of ORO virus in this region has been ongoing during many decades, and that people are at considerable risk of infection.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Baisley K J; Watts D M; Munstermann L E; Wilson M L; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nAntibodies, Viral/bl [Blood]\r\n*Bunyaviridae Infections/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nBunyaviridae Infections/im [Immunology]\r\n*Bunyaviridae Infections/tm [Transmission]\r\nChild\r\nChild, Preschool\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nImmunoglobulin G/bl [Blood]\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPeru/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nRisk Factors\r\nSeroepidemiologic Studies\r\nSimbu virus/im [Immunology]\r\n*Simbu virus\r\nTime Factors\r\nTravel","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Baisley K J, Watts D M, Munstermann L E, and Wilson M L (1998) Epidemiology of endemic Oropouche virus transmission in upper Amazonian Peru.

Despite their importance in public heath very little is known about the host cell factors hijacked by these viruses to support assembly and cell egress. Here we show that assembly of Oropouche virus, a member of the genus Orthobunyavirus that causes a frequent arboviral infection in South America countries, involves budding of virus particles toward the lumen of Golgi cisternae. As viral replication progresses, these Golgi subcompartments become enlarged and physically separated from Golgi stacks, forming Oropouche viral factory (Vfs) units. At the ultrastructural level, these virally modified Golgi cisternae acquire an MVB appearance, and while they lack typical early and late endosome markers, they become enriched in endosomal complex required for transport (ESCRT) proteins that are involved in MVB biogenesis. Further microscopy and viral replication analysis showed that functional ESCRT machinery is required for efficient Vf morphogenesis and production of infectious OROV particles. Taken together, our results indicate that OROV attracts ESCRT machinery components to Golgi cisternae to mediate membrane remodeling events required for viral assembly and budding at these compartments. This represents an unprecedented mechanism of how viruses hijack host cell components for coordinated morphogenesis.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Barbosa Natalia S; Mendonca Leila R; Dias Marcos V.

We used recombinant expression of the OROV M polyprotein, which encodes the surface glycoproteins Gn and Gc plus the nonstructural protein NSm, to probe the cellular determinants for OROV assembly and budding. Gn and Gc self-assemble and are secreted independently of NSm. Mature OROV Gn has two predicted transmembrane domains that are crucial for glycoprotein translocation to the Golgi complex and glycoprotein secretion, and unlike related orthobunyaviruses, both transmembrane domains are retained during Gn maturation. Disruption of Golgi function using the drugs brefeldin A and monensin inhibits glycoprotein secretion. Infection studies have previously shown that the cellular endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery is recruited to Golgi membranes during OROV assembly and that ESCRT activity is required for virus secretion. A dominant-negative form of the ESCRT-associated ATPase VPS4 significantly reduces recombinant OROV glycoprotein secretion and blocks virus release from infected cells, and VPS4 partly colocalizes with OROV glycoproteins and membranes costained with Golgi markers. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation and fluorescence microscopy experiments demonstrate that OROV glycoproteins interact with the ESCRT-III component CHMP6, with overexpression of a dominant-negative form of CHMP6 significantly reducing OROV glycoprotein secretion. Taken together, our data highlight differences in M polyprotein processing across orthobunyaviruses, indicate that Golgi and ESCRT function are required for glycoprotein secretion, and identify CHMP6 as an ESCRT-III component that interacts with OROV glycoproteins. IMPORTANCE Oropouche virus causes Oropouche fever, a debilitating illness common in South America that is characterized by high fever, headache, myalgia, and vomiting. The tripartite genome of this zoonotic virus is capable of reassortment, and there have been multiple epidemics of Oropouche fever in South America over the last 50 years, making Oropouche virus infection a significant threat to public health. However, the molecular characteristics of this arbovirus are poorly understood. We developed a recombinant protein expression system to investigate the cellular determinants of OROV glycoprotein maturation and secretion. We show that the proteolytic processing of the M polypeptide, which encodes the surface glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) plus a nonstructural protein (NSm), differs between OROV and its close relative Bunyamwera virus. Furthermore, we demonstrate that OROV M glycoprotein secretion requires the cellular endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) membrane-remodeling machinery and identify that the OROV glycoproteins interact with the ESCRT protein CHMP6.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Barbosa Natalia S; Concha Juan O; daSilva Luis L.

Oropouche virus (OROV) causes large and explosive outbreaks of acute febrile illness in cities and villages in the Amazon and Central-Plateau regions. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 110 meningoencephalitis patients were analyzed. The RNA extracted from fluid was submitted to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and sequencing to identify OROV. Three CSF samples showed the presence of OROV causing infection in the central nervous system (CNS). These patients are adults. Two of the patients had other diseases affecting CNS and immune systems: neurocysticercosis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, respectively. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed that the OROV from the CSF of these patients belonged to genotype I.

In this study, the presence of herpesviruses (HHV), enteroviruses (EVs), and arboviruses were investigated in CSF samples from 165 patients with suspected CNS viral infection through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcriptase PCR. The genomes of one or more viral agents were detected in 29.7% (49/165) of the CSF samples. EVs were predominant (16/49; 32.6%) followed by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (22.4%), Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV) (20.4%), Cytomegalovirus (CMV) (18.4%), herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) (4.1%), (HSV-2) (4.1%), and the arboviruses (14.3%). Four of the arboviruses were of dengue virus (DENV) and three of oropouche virus (OROV). The detection of different viruses in the CNS of patients with meningitis or encephalitis highlight the importance of maintaining an active laboratory monitoring diagnostics with rapid methodology of high sensitivity in areas of viral hyperendemicity that may assist in clinical decisions and in the choice of antiviral therapy.

Here we compared the detection efficiency of Dengue (DEN), Yellow Fever (YF), Saint Louis Encephalitis (SLE), West Nile (WN), Ilheus (ILH), Group C (GC), Oropouche (ORO), Mayaro (MAY) and Venezuela Encephalitis Equine (VEE) viruses using a Modified Shell Vial Culture (MSVC) protocol to a Standard Cell Culture (SCC) protocol. First the MSVC and SCC protocols were compared using five dilutions for each of the following stock viruses: DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, DEN-4, YF, SLE, WN, ILH, GC, ORO, MAY and VEE. Next, patients' original sera from which viruses (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, YF, GC, ORO, MAY and VEE) had been previously isolated were compare by the two methods using five sera dilutions. In addition, seven sera that were positive for DEN-3 by RT-PCR and negative by SCC were processed by MSVC. The MSVC protocol was consistently 1-2 logs higher virus dilution more sensitive for virus detection than the SCC protocol for all stock Flaviviruses tested (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, DEN-4, YF, SLE, WN and ILH). MSVC was equal to or one log more sensitive for virus detection than SCC for the stock Bunyaviruses (GC and ORO). For the stock Alphavirus MAY, MSVC was equally or one log more sensitive for virus detection than SCC, while for VEE SCC was equally or one log more sensitive for virus detection than MSVC. MSVC was consistently one to two sera dilutions more sensitive than SCC for the detection of Flaviviruses from patients' sera. Both methods were approximately equally sensitive for the detection of Bunyaviruses from patients' sera and equal or one dilution less sensitive for the detection of Alphaviruses from patients' sera. Additionally, MSVC detected DEN virus in five of seven DEN-3 RT-PCR positive, SCC negative patients' sera.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Caceda Edna R; Kochel Tadeusz J; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Animals\r\n*Arboviruses/ip [Isolation & Purification]\r\n*Arboviruses/me [Metabolism]\r\nCell Culture Techniques/is [Instrumentation]\r\n*Cell Culture Techniques/mt [Methods]\r\nCell Line\r\n*Chemistry Techniques, Analytical/mt [Methods]\r\nChlorocebus aethiops\r\nDengue Virus/ip [Isolation & Purification]\r\nEncephalitis Virus, St. Louis/ip [Isolation & Purification]\r\nEncephalitis Virus, Venezuelan Equine/ip [Isolation & Purification]\r\nModels, Biological\r\nReproducibility of Results\r\nSpecies Specificity\r\nVero Cells\r\nWest Nile virus/ip [Isolation & Purification]\r\nYellow fever virus/ip [Isolation & Purification]","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Caceda Edna R, and Kochel Tadeusz J (2007) Application of modified shell vial culture procedure for arbovirus detection.

During a dengue outbreak in 2011/2012, 529 serum samples were collected from patients with acute febrile illness with symptoms for up to five days and 387 pools of female Culex quinquefasciatus captured in 2013 were subjected to nested-reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for segment S of the Simbu serogroup followed by nucleotide sequencing and virus isolation in Vero cells. Patients (5/529; 0.9%) from Cuiaba (n = 3), Varzea Grande (n = 1) and Nova Mutum (n = 1) municipalities were positive for the S segment of Oropouche virus (OROV). Additionally, eight/387 Cx. quinquefasciatus pools were positive for the segment, with a minimum infection rate of 2.3. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that all the samples belong to the subgenotype Ia, presenting high homology with OROV strains obtained from humans and animals in the Brazilian Amazon. The present paper reports the first detection of an Orthobunyavirus, possibly OROV, in patients and in Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes in MT. This finding reinforces the notion that arboviruses frequently reported in the Amazon Region circulate sporadically in MT during dengue outbreaks.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cardoso Belgath Fernandes; Serra Otacilia Pereira; Heinen Leticia Borges da Silva; Zuchi Nayara; Souza Victor Costa de; Naveca Felipe Gomes; Santos Marcelo Adriano Mendes dos; Slhessarenko Renata Dezengrini; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nAnimal Distribution\r\nAnimals\r\nBase Sequence\r\nBrazil/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nBunyaviridae Infections/bl [Blood]\r\n*Bunyaviridae Infections/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nChlorocebus aethiops\r\nCulex/cl [Classification]\r\n*Culex/vi [Virology]\r\nDengue/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nDisease Outbreaks\r\nFemale\r\nFever/pp [Physiopathology]\r\nFever/vi [Virology]\r\nGenotype\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nOrthobunyavirus/cl [Classification]\r\nOrthobunyavirus/ge [Genetics]\r\nPhylogeny\r\nPolymerase Chain Reaction\r\nPrevalence\r\n*RNA, Viral/ip [Isolation & Purification]\r\nSerogroup\r\n*Simbu virus/cl [Classification]\r\nSimbu virus/ge [Genetics]\r\nVero Cells\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cardoso Belgath Fernandes, Serra Otacilia Pereira, Heinen Leticia Borges da Silva, Zuchi Nayara, Souza Victor Costa de, Naveca Felipe Gomes, Santos Marcelo Adriano Mendes dos, and Slhessarenko Renata Dezengrini (2015) Detection of Oropouche virus segment S in patients and inCulex quinquefasciatus in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil.

The research aims to shed light on the potential use of this species as a natural antiviral agent., METHODS: The extracts were analysed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) system, a potent analytical technique to discover drug candidates. In the meantime, in vitro antiviral assays were performed against Mayaro, Oropouche, Chikungunya, and Zika viruses. In addition, the antiviral activity of annotated compounds was predicted by in silico methods., RESULTS: Overall, 44 compounds were annotated in this study. The results revealed that P. brasiliensis has a high content of fatty acids, flavones, flavan-3-ols, and lignans. Furthermore, in vitro assays revealed potent antiviral activity against different arboviruses, especially lignan-rich extracts against Zika virus (ZIKV), as follows: methanolic extract from bark (MEB) [effective concentration for 50% of the cells (EC<ovid:sub>50</ovid:sub> ) = 0.80 mug/mL, selectivity index (SI) = 377.59], methanolic extract from the leaf (MEL) (EC<ovid:sub>50</ovid:sub> = 0.84 mug/mL, SI = 297.62), and hydroalcoholic extract from the leaf (HEL) (EC<ovid:sub>50</ovid:sub> = 1.36 mug/mL, SI = 735.29). These results were supported by interesting in silico prediction, where tuberculatin (a lignan) showed a high antiviral activity score., CONCLUSIONS: Phyllanthus brasiliensis extracts contain metabolites that could be a new kick-off point for the discovery of candidates for antiviral drug development, with lignans becoming a promising trend for further virology research.

This study sought to assess the prevalence and distribution of haemagglutination-inhibition antibodies against antigens of nine different types of arbovirus of the Bunyaviridae family, where eight were Orthobunyavirus: Guaroa virus, Maguari virus, Tacaiuma virus, Utinga virus, Belem virus, Caraparu virus, Oropouche virus and Catu virus, and one Phlebovirus: Icoaraci virus in sera samples of water buffaloes in Pará State, Brazil. For all Arboviruses investigated there were antibodies, with the exception of Belem virus. Antibodies to Maguari virus were more prevalent (7.33%). The water buffaloes of the present study showed variable levels of antibodies in monotypic and heterotypic reactions that may indicate there are movements from most bunyavirus studied in domestic buffaloes in the state of Pará, and the Maguari virus presents the largest circulation. Therefore, further studies are needed to investigate the role of water buffalo in the maintenance and dispersal of arboviruses, as well as whether these viruses can cause disease in that species, especially in cases of birth defects and abortions.(AU) O Estado do Pará corresponde a 26% da Amazônica brasileira, onde uma grande quantidade de Arbovírus tem sido descrito.

It has a jungle and an urban cycle, and shares the same clinical features with dengue, but with limited cutaneous involvement and a greater tendency to recur. Since its first isolation in humans until 2011, more than 30 outbreaks have been reported and at least 500 000 people infected. Objective: To describe an outbreak of Oropuche fever in Cajamarca region in 2011. Methods: Cross-sectional study. The geographical scope of the outbreak was largely rural. The population shows a fluid migration exchanges with dengue endemic areas. The investigation began after detecting an increase of febrile patients by syndromic surveillance. An institutional and community active search of suspect and probable cases of dengue according to health directives was performed. Results: We investigated a total of 33 patients who met the definition for a probable case of dengue, all with favorable course, 31 cases were autochthonous. The laboratory of the National Institute of Health (NIH) confirmed for the first time in the province of Cutervo, Cajamarca region, the presence of antibodies to the virus Oropuche in 17 of 26 samples. Initial management of the outbreak was oriented along the clinical and epidemiological context for dengue, which caused delays in the diagnostic confirmation period and therefore in the implementation of intervention measures. Conclusions: Oropuche fever is one of the differential diagnosis of dengue, as such, surveillance systems and laboratory network in the country should be strengthened in early detection and control.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Castro Sara; Banda Luis; Cabellos Dilthey; Luna Deysi; Muñoz Juan; Cley Condor; Yudy; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Castro Sara, Banda Luis, Cabellos Dilthey, Luna Deysi, Muñoz Juan, Cley Condor, and Yudy (2013) Oropuche fever outbreak in two villages of the region Cajamarca, Peru, 2011.

HERVs induction is associated with neurogenesis, cellular development, immune activation, and neurological disorders. Arboviruses are often associated with the development of encephalitis. The interplay between these viruses and HERVs has not been fully elucidated. In this work, we analyzed RNAseq data derived from infected human primary astrocytes by Zika (ZikV), Mayaro (MayV), Oropouche (OroV) and Chikungunya (ChikV) viruses, and evaluated the modulation of HERVs and their nearby genes. Our data show common HERVs expression modulation by both alphaviruses, suggesting conserved evolutionary routes of transcription regulation. A total of 15 HERVs were co-modulated by the four arboviruses, including the highly upregulated HERV4_4q22. Data on the upregulation of genes nearby to these elements in ChikV, MayV and OroV infections were also obtained, and interaction networks were built. The upregulation of 14 genes common among all viruses was observed in the networks, and 93 genes between MayV and ChikV. These genes are related to cellular processes such as cellular replication, cytoskeleton, cell vesicle traffic and antiviral response. Together, our results support the role of HERVs induction in the transcription regulation process of genes during arboviral infections.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Castro Fernando Luz de; Brustolini Otavio Jose Bernandes; Geddes Victor Emmanuel Viana; Souza Jorge Paes Barreto Marcondes de; Alves-Leon Soniza Vieira; Aguiar Renato Santana; Vasconcelos Ana Tereza Ribeiro; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Humans\r\n*Arboviruses\r\nEndogenous Retroviruses/ge [Genetics]\r\n*Endogenous Retroviruses\r\n*Zika Virus Infection\r\nZika Virus/ge [Genetics]\r\n*Zika Virus\r\nAstrocytes\r\n*Chikungunya virus\r\n*Chikungunya Fever\r\n*Encephalitis","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Castro Fernando Luz de, Brustolini Otavio Jose Bernandes, Geddes Victor Emmanuel Viana, Souza Jorge Paes Barreto Marcondes de, Alves-Leon Soniza Vieira, Aguiar Renato Santana, and Vasconcelos Ana Tereza Ribeiro (2022) Modulation of HERV Expression by Four Different Encephalitic Arboviruses during Infection of Human Primary Astrocytes.

We collected a total of 196 samples from 103 Leontopithecus chrysomelas, 7 Sapajus xanthosternos, 22 Bradypus torquatus and 7 Bradypus variegatus. Serum samples were tested using neutralization test and hemagglutination inhibition test to detect total antibodies against 26 different arboviruses. The overall prevalence of arboviruses was 36.6% (51/139), with the genus Flavivirus having the highest prevalence (33.1%; 46/139), followed by Phlebovirus (5.0%; 7/139), Orthobunyavirus (4.3%; 6/139) and Alphavirus (0.7%; 1/139). Monotypic reactions suggest that the wild animals were exposed naturally to at least twelve arboviruses. Added results from the neutralization test, animals were exposed to thirteen arboviruses. Most of these viruses are maintained in transmission cycles independent of human hosts, although antibodies against dengue virus serotypes 1, 2 and 3 were found in this study. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting exposure to arboviruses in L. chrysomelas, S. xanthosternos and B. torquatus. Our results also highlight that the Southern Bahia Atlantic Forest has a variety of vertebrate hosts and potential vectors, which may support the emergence or re-emergence of arboviruses, including those pathogenic to humans.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Catenacci L S; Ferreira M; Martins L C; De Vleeschouwer K M; Cassano C R; Oliveira L C; Canale G; Deem S L; Tello J S; Parker P; Vasconcelos P F.

Exploring demographic, household and environmental conditions under which infectious diseases occur may inform strategies to prevent disease emergence in human populations. We collected blood samples from 523 humans and explore factors for arbovirus emergence in Bahia, Brazil. The overall arbovirus seroprevalence was 65.2%, with the genus Flavivirus most prevalent (64.4%). Based on monotypic reactions, the population had contact with five arbovirus: Dengue 3, Ilheus, Oropouche, Caraparu and Eastern equine encephalitis virus. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting exposure to Oropouche, Caraparu and Eastern equine encephalitis virus in human populations in Bahia, Northeast of Brazil. The best model fit demonstrated that household and environmental variables were more predictive of the risk of arbovirus exposure than demographic variables. The presence of forest and free-living monkeys in the areas close to the communities had a protective effect for the human population (i.e. lower seroprevalence). The dilution effect is considered as one explanation for this finding. These results highlight the important ecological role of wildlife-friendly agriculture.

We conducted health facility-based AFI surveillance at four sites in Colombia (Cucuta, Cali, Villavicencio, Leticia) during 2019-2022. Demographic, clinical and risk factor data were collected from persons with AFI that consented to participate in the study (n = 2,967). Serologic specimens were obtained and tested for multiple pathogens by RT-PCR and rapid test (Antigen/IgM), with 20.7% identified as dengue positive from combined testing. Oropouche virus (OROV) was initially detected in serum by metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and virus target capture in a patient from Cucuta. Three additional infections from Leticia were confirmed by conventional PCR, sequenced, and isolated in tissue culture. Phylogenetic analysis determined there have been at least two independent OROV introductions into Colombia. To assess OROV spread, a RT-qPCR dual-target assay was developed which identified 87/791 (10.9%) viremic cases in AFI specimens from Cali (3/53), Cucuta (3/19), Villavicencio (38/566), and Leticia (43/153). In parallel, an automated anti-nucleocapsid antibody assay detected IgM in 27/503 (5.4%) and IgG in 92/568 (16.2%) patients screened, for which 24/68 (35.3%) of PCR positives had antibodies. Dengue was found primarily in people aged <18 years and linked to several clinical manifestations (weakness, skin rash and petechiae), whereas Oropouche cases were associated with the location, climate phase, and odynophagia symptom. Our results confirm OROV as an emerging pathogen and recommend increased surveillance to determine its burden as a cause of AFI in Colombia.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ciuoderis Karl A; Berg Michael G; Perez Lester J; Hadji Abbas; Perez-Restrepo Laura S; Aristizabal Leidi Carvajal; Forberg Kenn; Yamaguchi Julie; Cardona Andres; Weiss Sonja; Qiu Xiaoxing; Hernandez-Ortiz Juan Pablo; Averhoff Francisco; Cloherty Gavin A; Osorio Jorge E; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Humans\r\nColombia/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nPhylogeny\r\nBunyaviridae Infections/co [Complications]\r\nBunyaviridae Infections/ep [Epidemiology]\r\n*Bunyaviridae Infections","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ciuoderis Karl A, Berg Michael G, Perez Lester J, Hadji Abbas, Perez-Restrepo Laura S, Aristizabal Leidi Carvajal, Forberg Kenn, Yamaguchi Julie, Cardona Andres, Weiss Sonja, Qiu Xiaoxing, Hernandez-Ortiz Juan Pablo, Averhoff Francisco, Cloherty Gavin A, and Osorio Jorge E (2022) Oropouche virus as an emerging cause of acute febrile illness in Colombia.

Oropouche fever is a neglected mosquito-borne disease that still lacks options for antiviral treatment. We developed a high-throughput screening phenotypic assay using human hepatocyte-derived HuH-7.0 cells to screen over 7700 compounds against OROV infection. We identified 13 hit compounds that were protective against OROV-induced cytopathic effect in cell culture, of which 3 were confirmed: lysergol, amiloride hydrochloride, and pyridostatin TFA, with EC50 values below 2 mcM. Orthogonal assays indicate that both lysergol and pyridostatin present antiviral activity against OROV in HuH-7.0 and T24 cell lines, but lysergol is far more potent, causing up to a 100,000-fold reduction in viral load in the low micromolar range. Mechanistic studies indicate that the antiviral effect of lysergol affects early stages of viral replication, and that lysergol is also active against a recently isolated OROV strain. In conclusion, our phenotypical screening campaign led to the identification of a first-in-class compound with potent antiviral activity against the emerging OROV in cell culture. We conclude that high-throughput screening assays can be implemented in response to the emergence of arboviruses and accelerate the discovery of candidate treatments. Copyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

The primary patient, a 58-year-old female, exhibited symptoms including fever, arthromyalgia, headache, diarrhea, and vomiting. Real-time RT-PCR assays confirmed both infections, with dengue virus RNA detected up to 18 days and Oropouche virus RNA up to 36 days after symptom onset in whole blood samples. The other three patients, identified through serological testing, showed prolonged detection of Oropouche virus RNA in whole blood samples up to 95 days after symptom onset. Notably, one patient had detectable Oropouche virus RNA in plasma up to 90 days post-symptom onset, likely due to higher RNA levels. Urine samples were positive for Oropouche virus RNA in the primary patient up to 20 days after symptom onset. These findings highlight the importance of considering co-infections in travelers from endemic areas, the critical role of whole blood samples in detecting and monitoring Oropouche virus infections, and the need for further research into the virus's persistence and replication in blood cells to manage its spread effectively.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Colavita Francesca; Carletti Fabrizio; D'Abramo Alessandra; Nicastri Emanuele; Maggi Fabrizio; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"blood\r\nblood cells\r\nconcurrent infections\r\ndengue\r\ndiarrhoea\r\nfever\r\ngastroenteritis\r\nheadaches\r\nhuman diseases\r\nmosquito-borne diseases\r\nmyalgia\r\nOropouche virus disease\r\nRNA\r\nsymptoms\r\ntravel associated diseases\r\ntravellers\r\nurine\r\nviral diseases","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Colavita Francesca, Carletti Fabrizio, D'Abramo Alessandra, Nicastri Emanuele, and Maggi Fabrizio (2025) Prolonged detection of Oropouche virus RNA in whole blood samples.

OROV belongs to the Peribunyaviridae family, a large group of RNA viruses. Little is known about the biology of Peribunyaviridae in host cells, especially assembly and egress processes. Our research reveals that the small GTPase Rab27a mediates intracellular transport of OROV induced compartments and viral release from infected cells. We show that Rab27a interacts with OROV glycoproteins and colocalizes with OROV during late phases of the infection cycle. Moreover, Rab27a activity is required for OROV trafficking to the cell periphery and efficient release of infectious particles. Consistently, depleting Rab27a's downstream effector, Myosin Va, or inhibiting actin polymerization also hinders OROV compartments targeting to the cell periphery and infectious viral particle egress. These data indicate that OROV hijacks Rab27a activity for intracellular transport and cell externalization. Understanding these crucial mechanisms of OROV's replication cycle may offer potential targets for therapeutic interventions and aid in controlling the spread of Oropouche fever.

While disease is generally self-limiting, historical and recent reports of neurologic involvement highlight the importance of understanding the neuropathogenesis of OROV. In this study, we characterize viral replication kinetics in neurons and microglia derived from immortalized, primary, and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cells, which are all permissive to infection. We demonstrate that ex vivo rat brain slice cultures can be infected by OROV and produce antiviral cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6, TNF-alpha and IFN-beta, which introduces an additional model to study viral kinetics in the central nervous system. These findings provide additional insight into OROV neuropathogenesis and in vitro modeling strategies for a newly re-emerging arbovirus.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Connors Kaleigh A; Pedlow Maris R; Frey Zachary D; McGaughey Jackson J; Amarasinghe Gaya K; Duprex W Paul; D'Aiuto Leonardo; Wills Zachary P; Hartman Amy L; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Connors Kaleigh A, Pedlow Maris R, Frey Zachary D, McGaughey Jackson J, Amarasinghe Gaya K, Duprex W Paul, D'Aiuto Leonardo, Wills Zachary P, and Hartman Amy L (2024) Characterization of neural infection by Oropouche orthobunyavirus. bioRxiv , "},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":17036613,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":17072617,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":17036567,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":17036565,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"Outcomes":[],"ItemId":109133605,"Title":"Serological survey for arboviruses in Juruti, Pará State, Brazil","ParentTitle":"Cad. saúde pública","ShortTitle":"Cruz (2009)","DateCreated":"10/02/2025","CreatedBy":"Matthew Bosworth","DateEdited":"16/05/2025","EditedBy":"Matthew Bosworth","Year":"2009","Month":"","StandardNumber":"0102-311X","City":"","Country":"","Publisher":"","Institution":"Cruz, Ana Cecilia Ribeiro; Instituto Evandro Chagas.

In  Rio de Janeiro state there has been a significant rise in suspected cases of arboviruses, with only 30% of laboratory tests confirming infections with dengue, Zika or chikungunya viruses. The investigation of OROV virus circulation in Rio de Janeiro state was initiated and confirmed in April 2024. Objectives Our study aimed to retrospectively investigate OROV infections in dengue suspected cases with inconclusive diagnosis in order to better understand the temporal and geographic introduction of OROV in Rio de Janeiro state. Study design: Municipalities from Rio de Janeiro with arbovirus-like fever cases but low percentage of dengue confirmations were identified in the laboratory database. Samples were selected for testing OROV infections using real-time RT-PCR as recommended by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Results: Municipalities in the Middle Paraíba region of the state showed 93% of negative tests results for dengue, Zika, and chikungunya starting in September 2023. A total of, 118 positive cases of OROV were recorded in the state of Rio de Janeiro between March and July 2024. Moreover, by genome sequencing, it was shown that OROV circulating belongs to recently emergent M1L2S2 lineage. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the OROV, lineage M1L2S2, was probably introduced into the State of Rio de Janeiro through the Middle Paraíba region, where a higher number of cases was detected.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"da Costa Fábio; Cavalcanti Andrea; Erbisti Rafael; Zaquieu Dias; Vanessa; Moreira Cristiane; Marques Grifo; Mateus; Vaz Maria Carmelita; Camargo Adriana Cardoso; de Souza Leandro; dos Santos; Flávia; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"da Costa Fábio, Cavalcanti Andrea, Erbisti Rafael, Zaquieu Dias, Vanessa, Moreira Cristiane, Marques Grifo, Mateus, Vaz Maria Carmelita, Camargo Adriana Cardoso, de Souza Leandro, dos Santos, and Flávia (2024) Introduction and Spatial-Temporal Distribution of Oropouche Virus in Rio De Janeiro State, Brazil.

Mosquitoes tested included Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti (1139 males; 84 pools), Culex quinquefasciatus (9426 males; 179 pools), Culex sp. (3 males; 3 pools) and Psorophora albigenu (1 male; 1 pool) collected from four cities of MT. Pools were subjected to viral RNA extraction followed by RT-PCRs specific for ten flaviviruses, five alphaviruses and Simbu serogroup of orthobunyaviruses. Positive pools were passaged three times in VERO cells (alphavirus and orthobunyavirus) or C6/36 cells (flavivirus), with isolates confirmed through RT-PCR and nucleotide sequencing. We detected pools positive for Ilheus (1 pool), dengue serotype 4 (1), Mayaro (12), equine encephalitis virus (1) yellow fever (1), Oropouche (2), Zika (4) and chikungunya (12) viruses. High throughput sequencing of arbovirus positive pools identified 35 insect-specific viruses (ISVs) from the families Circoviridae (2), Parvoviridae (2), Totiviridae (1), Flaviviridae (1), Iflaviridae (2), Mesoniviridae (4), Nodaviridae (2), Luteoviridae (1), Phasmaviridae (1) Phenuiviridae (2), Rhabdoviridae (2), Orthomyxoviridae (1), Xinmoviridae (1), and unclassified Bunyavirales (1), unclassified Picornavirales (3), unclassified Riboviria (4) and taxon Negevirus (5).

More than half a million people have been infected with OROV since its isolation in 1955. Although Oropouche fever is classified as a neglected and emerging disease, to date, there are no antiviral drugs or vaccines available against the infection and little is known about its pathogenicity. Therefore, it is essential to elucidate the possible mechanisms involved in its pathogenesis. Since oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in the progression of various viral diseases, in this study, redox homeostasis in the target organs of OROV infection was evaluated using an animal model. Infected BALB/c mice exhibited reduced weight gain, splenomegaly, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, development of anti-OROV neutralizing antibodies, increased liver transaminases, and serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). The OROV genome and infectious particles were detected in the liver and spleen of infected animals, with liver inflammation and an increase in the number and total area of lymphoid nodules in the spleen. In relation to redox homeostasis in the liver and spleen, infection led to an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, increased oxidative stress biomarkers malondialdehyde (MDA) and carbonyl protein, and decreased activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). Taken together, these results help elucidate some important aspects of OROV infection that may contribute to the pathogenesis of Oropouche.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"da Silva Menegatto Marilia Bueno; Ferraz Ariane Coelho; Lima Rafaela Lameira Souza; Almeida Leticia Trindade; de Brito Rory Cristiane Fortes; Reis Alexandre Barbosa; Carneiro Claudia Martins; de Lima Wanderson Geraldo; de Mello Silva Breno; de Magalhaes Jose Carlos; Magalhaes Cintia Lopes de Brito; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Animals\r\nMice\r\nReactive Oxygen Species\r\nSpleen/pa [Pathology]\r\n*Spleen\r\n*Bunyaviridae Infections\r\nLiver/pa [Pathology]\r\nOxidative Stress","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"da Silva Menegatto Marilia Bueno, Ferraz Ariane Coelho, Lima Rafaela Lameira Souza, Almeida Leticia Trindade, de Brito Rory Cristiane Fortes, Reis Alexandre Barbosa, Carneiro Claudia Martins, de Lima Wanderson Geraldo, de Mello Silva Breno, de Magalhaes Jose Carlos, and Magalhaes Cintia Lopes de Brito (2023) Oropouche virus infection induces ROS production and oxidative stress in liver and spleen of mice.

In 2024, an epidemic of Oropouche fever spread in Brazil, with more than 7930 cases reported between Jan 1 and Aug 31. Infections in pregnant people have suggested the possibility of negative fetal consequences, therefore we tested newborns with microcephaly for known congenital pathogens and Oropouche virus (OROV)., METHODS: In this case series, we assessed historical cases of infants born with microcephaly, arthrogryposis, and other congenital malformations without a confirmed cause and their mothers for potential OROV congenital infections. The study population consisted of infants born in Brazil with samples from 2015-21 and 2024. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from this case series were analysed for: syphilis, toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, HIV, Zika, dengue, and chikungunya. Individuals that were negative for these pathogens were then tested for OROV. Pathogen testing included ELISA and haemagglutination inhibition testing for antibodies and RT-PCR for virus RNA., FINDINGS: We tested 68 samples from 65 historical cases of congential malformations and three cases from 2024. All cases were from ten states in Brazil. Three historical cases tested positive for OROV and 62 historical cases tested negative. The three cases from 2024 all tested positive for OROV. Of the positive cases, five were female and one was male. Not all pathogens were tested for each case, and some did not have maternal samples available. One of the newborns (case 6) died aged 47 days and tissue samples were tested by real-time RT-PCR, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry assays. One other newborn died in 2016 but no post-mortem samples were available. OROV IgM was detected in five of five newborn CSF samples, and five of five newborn serum samples. Four of five maternal serum samples were positive for OROV IgM. One of four newborn CSF samples (case 6 at age 44 days) was OROV positive by real-time RT-quantitative PCR and 0 of four newborn serum samples were positive, as were 0 of three maternal serum samples. Case 6 had major tissue changes of the brain macroscopically and microscopically, including necrotic and apoptotic changes of neurons, microglia and astrocytes, vacuolisation, and tissue atrophy. OROV RNA was detected in brain, lungs, kidney, CSF, and pleural fluid; OROV antigens were found in CNS, liver, kidney, heart, and lung, mainly in neurons and microglia and also in endothelial cells, suggesting vasculitis., INTERPRETATION: We detected OROV IgM in six of 68 newborns with microcephaly of unknown cause. One infant who died had OROV RNA and antigen in several tissues, including the brain. The possibility of OROV vertical transmission and potential fetal harm must be investigated with urgency. The evidence presented here does not completely confirm vertical transmission or congenital malformations due to OROV, but thorough case finding and detailed investigation of maternal or fetal OROV infection is a priority., FUNDING: Evandro Chagas Institute, Secretaria de Vigilancia em Saude e Ambiente, and Ministry of Health and National Institute of Science and Technology for Emerging and Reemerging Viruses.

The recent re-emergence of Oropouche virus (OROV) has added complexity to vector control strategies, emphasizing the need for integrated approaches to curb arboviruses spread. We aimed to analyze temporal trends and spatial distributions with national scope of these emerging arboviruses., METHODS: An ecological study using data from the Brazilian Notifiable Diseases Information System the period from 2023 to 2024 was undertaken. Temporal trends were evaluated using Joinpoint regression, while spatial analysis was conducted using Moran's I, and local indicators of spatial association., RESULTS: Dengue fever cases increased by 322%, while Oropouche fever (OF) increased by 300%. The states of Amazonas and Espirito Santo reported increases in OF cases. Moran's I test revealed spatial clustering of DENV and CHIKV. Two municipalities in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul showed cocirculation of DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV., CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a surge in arbovirus cases between 2023 and 2024, with peak incidences from January to March and October to December, linked to favorable climatic conditions. Clustering patterns and co-circulation of arboviruses highlight the need for tailored control and prevention strategies and targeted interventions to mitigate their impact.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Daudt-Lemos Matheus; Ramos-Silva Alice; Faustino Renan; Noronha Tatiana Guimaraes de; Vianna Renata Artimos de Oliveira; Cabral-Castro Mauro Jorge; Cardoso Claudete Aparecida Araujo; Silva Andrea Alice; Carvalho Fabiana Rabe; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Brazil/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nHumans\r\nIncidence\r\n*Communicable Diseases, Emerging/ep [Epidemiology]\r\n*Communicable Diseases, Emerging/vi [Virology]\r\nSpatio-Temporal Analysis\r\n*Arbovirus Infections/ep [Epidemiology]\r\n*Arbovirus Infections/vi [Virology]\r\n*Arboviruses/cl [Classification]\r\nChikungunya Fever/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nZika Virus Infection/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nDengue/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nZika Virus\r\nDisease Outbreaks\r\nDengue Virus\r\nChikungunya virus\r\nSpatial Analysis","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Daudt-Lemos Matheus, Ramos-Silva Alice, Faustino Renan, Noronha Tatiana Guimaraes de, Vianna Renata Artimos de Oliveira, Cabral-Castro Mauro Jorge, Cardoso Claudete Aparecida Araujo, Silva Andrea Alice, and Carvalho Fabiana Rabe (2025) Rising Incidence and Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Emerging and Reemerging Arboviruses in Brazil.

Since its identification in 1955, OROV has been responsible for outbreaks in both rural and urban areas, with transmission involving sylvatic and urban cycles. This study focuses on the characterization of an OROV isolate from a human clinical sample collected in the state of Rio de Janeiro, a non-endemic region in Brazil, highlighting ultrastructural and morphological aspects of the viral replicative cycle in Vero cells. OROV was isolated in Vero cell monolayers which, following viral inoculation, exhibited marked cytopathic effects (CPEs), mainly represented by changes in cell morphology, including membrane protrusions and vacuolization, as well as cell death. Studies by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed significant ultrastructural changes, such as apoptosis, intense remodeling of membrane-bound organelles and signs of rough endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial stress. Additionally, the formation of specialized cytoplasmic vacuoles and intra- and extracellular vesicles emphasized trafficking and intercellular communication as essential mechanisms in OROV infection. RT-qPCR studies confirmed the production of viral progeny in high titers, corroborating the efficiency of this experimental model. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the cytopathogenic mechanisms of OROV infection and the contribution of cellular alterations in OROV morphogenesis.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"de Almeida Ana Luisa Teixeira; da Costa Igor Pinto Silva; Garcia Maycon Douglas do Nascimento; da Silva Marcos Alexandre Nunes; Lazzaro Yasmim Goncalves; de Filippis Ana Maria Bispo; Nogueira Fernanda de Bruycker; Barreto-Vieira Debora Ferreira; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Brazil/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nHumans\r\nAnimals\r\nChlorocebus aethiops\r\nVero Cells\r\n*Orthobunyavirus/ip [Isolation & Purification]\r\n*Orthobunyavirus/ul [Ultrastructure]\r\n*Orthobunyavirus/ge [Genetics]\r\n*Orthobunyavirus/cl [Classification]\r\n*Bunyaviridae Infections/vi [Virology]\r\nMicroscopy, Electron, Transmission\r\nVirus Replication\r\nPhylogeny\r\nCytopathogenic Effect, Viral\r\nRNA, Viral/ge [Genetics]","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"de Almeida Ana Luisa Teixeira, da Costa Igor Pinto Silva, Garcia Maycon Douglas do Nascimento, da Silva Marcos Alexandre Nunes, Lazzaro Yasmim Goncalves, de Filippis Ana Maria Bispo, Nogueira Fernanda de Bruycker, and Barreto-Vieira Debora Ferreira (2025) Oropouche Virus: Isolation and Ultrastructural Characterization from a Human Case Sample from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Using an In Vitro System.

Objective This paper had the objective to estimate the prevalence of antibodies to arbovirus in communities that live under the influence of the artificial lake of UHE Tucuruí in the State of Pará, Brazil. Method The analytical transversal study has selected 657 blood serum samples of individuals over 18, both genders, residents at the Sustainable Development Reserves (SDR) in the region of the lake of UHE Tucuruí. The epidemiological information has been registered in an instrument especially designed for such a study and the blood samples were collected in two periods of high and low tide of the lake. The blood serum tests were performed by the method of hemagglutination inhibition (HI). Results The results revealed a prevalence of positive antibodies to arbovirus of 85.0%, being 84.1% related to Flavivirus (vaccine strain of YFV), 25.5% related to Alphavirus and 34.6% to Bunyavirus. The results of serum prevalence to arbovirus between the periods of high tide and low tide have revealed significance amongst the Alphavirus, not observed in the other families. Conclusion In general, the data from this paper have suggested that the anthropoid actions on the environment of the lake have become determinant factors for the prevalence of arboviral antibodies.","Comments":"Copyright - ©2018.

In Brazil, human cases have been historically concentrated in the northern region of the country. Oropouche fever in humans range from mild clinical signs to rare neurological events, and is considered a neglected tropical disease in Brazil. Due to the clinical similarities to other arboviruses, such as chikungunya and dengue viruses, OROV infections are likely to be underreported. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) cases in Brazil were first recognized in 2014 in the states of Amapa and Bahia in the north and northeast regions, respectively. Both OROV and CHIKV cause nonspecific symptoms, making clinical diagnosis difficult in a scenario of arbovirus cocirculation. Aiming to investigate OROV transmission during the CHIKV introduction in the state of Amapa located in the Brazilian Amazon, we conducted a retrospective molecular (RT-qPCR) and serological investigation in febrile cases (N = 166) collected between August 2014 and May 2015. All acute serum samples were negative for OROV RNA using RT-qPCR. However, neutralizing antibodies for OROV were detected using a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT<ovid:sub>90</ovid:sub>) in 10.24% (17/166) of the patients, with neutralizing antibody titers ranging from 20 to >=640, suggesting the previous exposure of patients to OROV. Regarding CHIKV, recent exposure was confirmed by the detection of CHIKV RNA in 20.25% (33/163) of the patients and by the detection of anti-CHIKV IgM in 28.57% (44/154) of the patients. The additional detection of anti-CHIKV IgG in 12.58% (19/151) of the febrile patients suggests that some individuals had been previously exposed to CHIKV. Whether the OROV exposure reported here occurred prior or during the CHIKV circulation in Amapa, is unknown, but because those arboviral infections share similar clinical signs and symptoms, a silent circulation of enzootic arboviruses during the introduction of exotic arboviruses may occur, and highlights the importance of syndromic cases' surveillance to arboviruses in Brazil.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"de Lima Raquel Curtinhas; Dias Helver Goncalves; de Souza Thiara Manuele Alves; Familiar-Macedo Debora; Ribeiro Edcelha D'Athaide; Correa Valmir Correa E; Pauvolid-Correa Alex; de Azeredo Elzinandes Leal; Dos Santos; Flavia Barreto; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"de Lima Raquel Curtinhas, Dias Helver Goncalves, de Souza Thiara Manuele Alves, Familiar-Macedo Debora, Ribeiro Edcelha D'Athaide, Correa Valmir Correa E, Pauvolid-Correa Alex, de Azeredo Elzinandes Leal, Dos Santos, and Flavia Barreto (2024) Oropouche Virus Exposure in Febrile Patients during Chikungunya Virus Introduction in the State of Amapa, Amazon Region, Brazil.

However, since late 2022, an increasing number of OROV cases have been reported across various regions of Brazil as well as in urban centers in Bolivia, Ecuador, Guyana, Colombia, Cuba, Panama, and Peru. In collaboration with Central Public Health Laboratories across Brazil, we integrated epidemiological metadata with genomic analyses from recent cases, generating 133 whole-genome sequences covering the virus's three genomic segments (L, M, and S). These include the first genomes from regions outside the Amazon and from the first recorded fatal cases. Phylogenetic analyses show that the 2024 OROV genomes form a monophyletic group with sequences from the Amazon Basin sampled since 2022, revealing a rapid north-to-south viral movement into historically non-endemic areas. We identified 21 reassortment events, though it remains unclear whether these genomic changes have facilitated viral adaptation to local ecological conditions or contributed to phenotypic traits of public health significance. Our findings demonstrate how OROV has evolved through reassortment and spread rapidly across multiple states in Brazil, leading to the largest outbreak ever recorded outside the Amazon and the first confirmed fatalities. Additionally, by analysing travel-related cases, we provide the first insights into the international spread of OROV beyond Brazil, further highlighting the role of human mobility in its dissemination. The virus's recent rapid geographic expansion and the emergence of severe cases emphasize the urgent need for enhanced surveillance across the Americas. In the absence of significant human population changes over the past two years, factors such as viral adaptation, deforestation, and climate shifts-either individually or in combination-may have facilitated the spread of OROV beyond the Amazon Basin through both local and travel-associated transmission.

Oropouche orthobunyavirus (OROV) is an arbovirus endemic to South and Central America tropical regions, responsible to several epidemic events in the last decades. There is little information regarding the ability of OROV to be transmitted by urban/peri-urban mosquitoes, which has limited the predictability of the emergence of permanent urban transmission cycles. Here, we evaluated the ability of OROV to infect, replicate, and be transmitted by three anthropophilic and urban species of mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus, and Culex quinquefasciatus. We show that OROV is able to infect and efficiently replicate when systemically injected in all three species tested, but not when orally ingested. Moreover, we find that, once OROV replication has occurred in the mosquito body, all three species were able to transmit the virus to immunocompromised mice during blood feeding. These data provide evidence that OROV is restricted by the midgut barrier of three major urban mosquito species, but, if this restriction is overcome, could be efficiently transmitted to vertebrate hosts. This poses a great risk for the emergence of permanent urban cycles and geographic expansion of OROV to other continents.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"de Mendonca Silvana F; Rocha Marcele N; Ferreira Flavia V; Leite Thiago H.

In Brazil, 13,785 cases were confirmed in 2024, with an additional 3680 reported by January 2025, according to the Ministry of Health. Initially restricted to the Amazon region, OROV has recently been detected in new areas, highlighting the need for enhanced surveillance and vector control strategies. While Culicoides paraensis is the primary vector, the potential role of other species in transmitting the currently circulating OROV strain in Brazil remains unclear. Here, we experimentally assessed the infectivity and dissemination of a recently isolated Oropouche orthobunyavirus (OROV) strain in two widespread mosquito species, Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus, collected from diverse regions of Brazil. Our results demonstrated that both mosquito species were refractory to oral infection, suggesting that natural transmission through these vectors is unlikely. However, in artificial systemic infection, Ae. aegypti showed viral replication and immune system activation, indicating its potential to support OROV replication under specific conditions. Additionally, to assess the potential impact of coinfection, we investigated whether Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an arbovirus that naturally infects Ae. aegypti, could facilitate OROV infection dynamics in this mosquito species. Our results suggest that coinfection does not promote OROV oral infection. Furthermore, we examined whether OROV systemic infection induced an immune response in Ae aegypti. We analyzed the major immune response pathways-RNAi, Toll, IMD, and JAK-STAT-and observed that the RNAi pathway was the most strongly activated in response to OROV infection in Ae. aegypti. These findings highlight the importance of ongoing surveillance and further studies on OROV evolution, vector adaptation, and transmission dynamics, particularly in urban settings where vector populations and viral interactions may facilitate new epidemiological scenarios.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"de Mendonca Silvana F; Baldon Livia V.

We conducted an investigation of arboviruses in patients with acute febrile illness for less than five days in Mato Grosso state (MT) during the period of ZIKV and CHIKV dissemination in Brazil. To achieve that, 453 human serum samples of patients suspected of Dengue (DENV), Yellow Fever (YFV), ZIKV or CHIKV collected in health units of 31 cities of MT were subjected to RT-PCR protocols for 10 flaviviruses, 5 alphaviruses and orthobunyaviruses from Simbu serogroup, nucleotide sequencing and viral isolation. Regarding flaviviruses, five (1.1%) patients were infected with DENV-1 genotype V, 22 (4.4%) with DENV-4 genotype II, 3 (0.7%) with YFV South American genotype II and five (1.1%) with ZIKV Asian genotype. The first human case of ZIKV in MT was detected in this study during August, 2015 in Tapurah. Alphaviruses were detected in 2 (0.4%) patients infected with CHIKV genotype ECSA, 1 (0.2%) with Madariaga (EEEV) lineage III and 34 (7.5%) with Mayaro (MAYV) genotype L. Four (11.4%) patients presented dual infections with DENV-1/ZIKV, DENV-1/DENV4, DENV-4/MAYV and ZIKV/MAYV. The majority - 13/34 positive for MAYV, one for Madariaga virus - are residents in Varzea Grande (VG), metropolitan region of Cuiaba, capital of MT. The first CHIKV infection in MT was detected in this study in Mirassol D'Oeste, during July, 2015. In addition, 20 (4.4%) patients were positive for OROV Segment S genotype IA. These results reinforce the variation in arboviruses frequency and distribution during outbreaks, highlinghing the importance of differential diagnosis to identify agents silently co-circulating with major health problem arboviruses.

Comparisons were made between surveys conducted inside an area where a dam was built (Tucurui, data collected since September 1982), before, during and after flooding, and in a comparable area where no dam was built (Altamira, data collected since 1974). Sera were collected from wild mammals, and human sera from febrile cases and random surveys. Haematophagous Diptera were sampled by human bait catches and CDC light traps. Results are presented and discussed in detail; in neither region did the prevalence of antibodies against arboviruses vary significantly over the period of the study. When Tucurui was compared to Altamira, arboviruses could be divided into 2 groups, those which showed enhanced transmission in the flooded as opposed to non-flooded area (Anopheles A virus group, Gamboa, Guaroa, Turlock, Kwatta-like, Oropouche, St Louis encephalitis, Maguari/Xingu and Triniti viruses), and those which showed no significant differences in transmission between the 2 areas (yellow fever, Mayaro, Ilheus, Tucunduba, eastern and western equine encephalitis, Icoaraci and Itaporanga viruses). These differences are compared to those of vector density. The merits of classifying arboviruses ecologically are emphasised.","Comments":"[et al.]","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Degallier N; Travassos da Rosa, A. P. A; Vasconcelos P F.

The etiologic agent, Oropouche virus (OROV), is a poorly understood arbovirus that has been known since the 1960s and represents a public health burden in Latin America. We report the whole-genome characterization of the first European OROV isolate from a returning traveler from Cuba with Oropouche fever-like symptoms. The isolate was obtained from the patient's serum; whole-genome sequencing was performed by next-generation sequencing, followed by phylogenetic analysis and genetic variability studies. The analysis showed that the most closely related sequence was from the French Guiana 2020 outbreak. Interestingly, our isolate is a reassortant virus, included in a highly supported monophyletic clade containing recent OROV cases (Brazil 2015-Colombia 2021), separated from the other four previously known genotypes. More deeply, it was found to be included in a distinct branch containing the sequences of the Brazil 2022-2024 outbreak. The reassortment event involved the S and L segments, which have high similarity with sequences belonging to a new cluster (here defined as OROV_SCDC_2024), while the M segment shows high similarity with older sequences. These results likely describe the viral strain responsible for the current outbreak in Cuba, which may also reflect the ongoing outbreak in Latin America. Further studies are needed to understand how OROV evolves towards traits that facilitate its spread and adaptation outside its original basin, and to track its spread and evolution in the European continent.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Deiana Michela; Malago Simone; Mori Antonio; Accordini Silvia; Matucci Andrea; Passarelli Mantovani; Rebeca; Gianesini Natasha; Huits Ralph; Piubelli Chiara; Gobbi Federico Giovanni; Capobianchi Maria Rosaria; Castilletti Concetta; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Cuba/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nHumans\r\n*Genome, Viral\r\n*Phylogeny\r\nOrthobunyavirus/ge [Genetics]\r\nOrthobunyavirus/cl [Classification]\r\nOrthobunyavirus/ip [Isolation & Purification]\r\n*Orthobunyavirus\r\nEurope/ep [Epidemiology]\r\n*Whole Genome Sequencing\r\nDisease Outbreaks\r\nReassortant Viruses/ge [Genetics]\r\nReassortant Viruses/cl [Classification]\r\nReassortant Viruses/ip [Isolation & Purification]\r\nBunyaviridae Infections/vi [Virology]\r\nBunyaviridae Infections/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nGenotype\r\nGenetic Variation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Deiana Michela, Malago Simone, Mori Antonio, Accordini Silvia, Matucci Andrea, Passarelli Mantovani, Rebeca, Gianesini Natasha, Huits Ralph, Piubelli Chiara, Gobbi Federico Giovanni, Capobianchi Maria Rosaria, and Castilletti Concetta (2024) Full Genome Characterization of the First Oropouche Virus Isolate Imported in Europe from Cuba.

Transmitted primarily through midge bites (Culicoides paraensis), OROV has no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine. This study aims to identify host-targeted therapeutics against OROV using computational approaches, offering a potential strategy for sustainable antiviral drug discovery. Methods: Virus-associated host targets were identified using the OMIM and GeneCards databases. The Enrichr and DSigDB platforms were used for drug prediction, filtering compounds based on Lipinski's rule for drug likeness. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis was conducted using the STRING database and Cytoscape 3.10.3 software. Four key host targets-IL10, FASLG, PTPRC, and FCGR3A-were prioritized based on their roles in immune modulation and OROV pathogenesis. Molecular docking simulations were performed using the PyRx software to evaluate the binding affinities of selected small-molecule inhibitors-Acetohexamide, Deptropine, Methotrexate, Retinoic Acid, and 3-Azido-3-deoxythymidine-against the identified targets. Results: The PPI network analysis highlighted immune-mediated pathways such as Fc-gamma receptor signaling, cytokine control, and T-cell receptor signaling as critical intervention points. Molecular docking revealed strong binding affinities between the selected compounds and the prioritized targets, suggesting their potential efficacy as host-targeting antiviral candidates. Acetohexamide and Deptropine showed strong binding to multiple targets, indicating broad-spectrum antiviral potential. Further in vitro and in vivo validations are needed to confirm these findings and translate them into clinically relevant treatments. Conclusions: This study highlights the potential of using computational approaches to identify host-targeted therapeutics for Oropouche virus (OROV).

Outbreaks of febrile illness associated with MAYV and OROV have been reported among humans mainly in the northern region of Brazil since the 1980s, and recent data suggest these viruses have circulated also in more populated areas of western Brazil. MAYV shares mosquito vectors with yellow fever virus and it has been historically detected during yellow fever epidemics. Aiming to investigate the transmission of OROV and MAYV at the human-animal interface during a yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika outbreaks in Brazil, we conducted a retrospective molecular investigation in 810 wild and domestic animals, 106 febrile patients, and 22.931 vectors collected from 2016 to 2018 in Cuiaba and Campo Grande metropolitan regions, western Brazil. All samples tested negative for OROV and MAYV RNA by RT-qPCR. Findings presented here suggest no active circulation of MAYV and OROV in the sampled hosts. Active surveillance and retrospective investigations are instrumental approaches for the detection of cryptic and subclinical activity of enzootic arboviruses and together serve as a warning system to implement appropriate actions to prevent outbreaks.

It also assesses the relationship of antibody prevalences to several environmental variables. Among others results, a clearcut and consistent relationship was documented between age and sex on the one hand and acquisition of arbovirus antibodies on the other. Most arbovirus attack rates were higher for adult males than for other segments of the study population, and men who slept as well as worked in the forest were especially likely to be attacked.","Comments":"BE added link under DOI, and removed url (http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed3&NEWS=N&AN=11003249)","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dixon K E; Llewellyn C H; Travassos da Rosa, A.

However, between 2022 and 2024, it reemerged as a more widespread public health concern in South America. We conducted a pooled-sample molecular surveillance to understand the true prevalence of Oropouche fever in Brazil's southernmost state. Over 18 months, we analyzed 4,060 samples to monitor the virus emergence in the Rio Grande do Sul state. We detected the first human case of Oropouche virus in the state, and our phylogenetic reconstruction indicated a travel-related introduction from Amazon region into Rio Grande do Sul. Despite the absence of local transmission, the invasion of Culicoides paraensis and enzootic circulation of the Oropouche virus in Rio Grande do Sul highlight the risk of Oropouche fever outbreaks in the region. We demonstrated that pooled-sample surveillance effectively monitors virus introduction during periods of low endemic circulation, serving as an essential active surveillance tool for the timely detection of virus emergence and enhancing public health preparedness. The multiple introductions of distinct Oropouche virus lineages into southern Brazil underscorethe importance of genomic surveillance and public health strategies to monitor and mitigate arbovirus spread in the region.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The diagnosis and prediction of the clinical picture continue to be a great challenge for clinicians who manage patients with acute febrile syndrome. Several symptoms have been associated with OROV virus infection in patients with febrile syndrome; however, to date, there is no clinical prediction rule, which is a fundamental tool to help the approach of this infectious disease., OBJECTIVE: To assess the performance of a prediction model based solely on signs and symptoms to diagnose Oropouche virus infection in patients with acute febrile syndrome., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Validation study, which included 923 patients with acute febrile syndrome registered in the Epidemiological Surveillance database of three arbovirus endemic areas in Peru., RESULTS: A total of 97 patients (19%) were positive for OROV infection in the development group and 23.6% in the validation group. The area under the curve was 0.65 and the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, LR + and LR- were 78.2%, 35.1%, 27.6%, 83.6%, 1.20 and 0.62, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: The development of a clinical prediction model for the diagnosis of Oropouche based solely on signs and symptoms does not work well. This may be due to the fact that the symptoms are nonspecific and related to other arbovirus infections, which confuse and make it difficult to predict the diagnosis, especially in endemic areas of co-infection of these diseases. For this reason, epidemiological surveillance of OROV in various settings using laboratory tests such as PCR is important.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Durango-Chavez Hilda V; Toro-Huamanchumo Carlos J; Silva-Caso Wilmer; Martins-Luna Johanna; Aguilar-Luis Miguel Angel; Del Valle-Mendoza Juana; Puyen Zully M; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Bunyaviridae Infections/di [Diagnosis]\r\nBunyaviridae Infections/ep [Epidemiology]\r\n*Bunyaviridae Infections\r\nFever/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nHumans\r\nModels, Statistical\r\n*Orthobunyavirus\r\nPrognosis","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Durango-Chavez Hilda V, Toro-Huamanchumo Carlos J, Silva-Caso Wilmer, Martins-Luna Johanna, Aguilar-Luis Miguel Angel, Del Valle-Mendoza Juana, and Puyen Zully M (2022) Oropouche virus infection in patients with acute febrile syndrome: Is a predictive model based solely on signs and symptoms useful?.

Materials and methods: A longitudinal and descriptive study was performed between May 2000 and July 2001 in four health facilities: Chiclayito and Salitral in Piura, Yurimaguas Hospital, and San Juan Health Center in Loreto. Febrile patients between 5 and 65 years old were included with negative smears for Bartonella or negative thick smears for malaria. The following tests were performed in the samples obtained: indirect immunofluorescence for typhus (only in Piura), ELISA IgM for leptospirosis and ELISA IgM-IgG for dengue fever, yellow fever, Mayaro, Oropuche and Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE). Results: Isolation of dengue fever virus was achieved in 27 (6,3%) patients, VEE virus was found in five patients, and group C virus was found in one patient. Dengue fever 2 and 3 viruses were identified in Chiclayito. VEE and group C virus were isolated in San Juan patients. Anti-dengue fever IgM was found in 43 (9,6%) patients, and yellow fever IgM was found in 21 (4,7%) patients, most of them from Yurimaguas. Also, VEE IgM was found in seven patients, Mayaro virus IgM was found in one and Oropuche virus IgM was found in four. Leptospirosis was the second most frequent cause of febrile syndrome (3,8%); while typhus was confirmed using indirect immunofluorescence in five Chiclayito patients.

Culicoides paraensis has been considered the main vector of the Oropouche Virus (OROV) in the urban cycle of the disease in the neotropics. Due to the great abundance of Culicoides spp. in the State of Rondonia and its epidemiological history of OROV, we investigated the biting activity in humans, the abundance as a function of meteorological parameters and seasonality, and the detection of OROV. Entomological collections occurred in three municipalities from Brazilian State of Rondonia: Porto Velho, Ariquemes, and Ouro Preto do Oeste. GLMM's were used to determine if Culicoides spp. abundance was predicted by seasonal, diurnal, and meteorological factors. Total RNA was extracted from insects and viral RNA detection was performed using the S segment as the target region of OROV via RT-qPCR. In total, 7315 individuals were captured and identified as C. paraensis. In the dry season, 1488 individuals (24.5%) were recorded, 4591 (75.5%) in the rainy season, with peaks of biting activity between 4pm and 6pm. All variables showed a significative effect on the midge abundance. The rainy season, temperature between 30 degreeC and 32 degreeC and relative air humidity between 75% and 85% were the main predictive parameters for capturing the highest average number of insects. Our results confirm diurnal activity of C. paraensis and its greatest abundance in rainy periods. No sample was positive for the OROV, which could be explained by the virus absence in local human populations, C. paraensis as a minor vector species in the sampled localities, and probable low rate of infection of biting midges. Our findings on hourly and seasonal biting activities can provide support to intervention actions regarding vector control and surveillance of this species. This was the first study to collect and analyze biting midges in a region where human OROV cases had already been detected, but without previous information on entomovirological surveillance.

Diagnoses of acute febrile cases and entomological collections were performed between January and April 2024 in the urban setting of Porto Velho, a city located in the western Brazilian Amazon. A total of 904 human samples were evaluated using RT-qPCR, of which 328 were positive for OROV. In addition, 3,950 insects were captured and Culex quinquefasciatus was the most abundant and predominant species. Seven mosquito samples showed amplification for OROV from pools of Cx. quinquefasciatus, Limatus durhamii and Aedes albopictus. Due to the first record of OROV in the two latter species, our findings can support new hypotheses about potential or bridge vectors. In turn, the high density of Cx. quinquefasciatus reinforces the supposition of this species as the main urban vector in the Amazon in the absence of C. paraensis. Complementary studies of vector competence and capacity are necessary for confirmation. Copyright &#xa9; 2024.

We have previously shown that acquisition of a second non-infectious BM can enhance early dissemination of Zika virus (ZIKV), dengue virus, and chikungunya virus in Aedes aegypti and ZIKV in Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, yet it is unknown if other taxonomically-diverse virus-vector pairings show a similar trend under a sequential feeding regimen., METHODS: To test this, we evaluated the impact of a second noninfectious BM on the vector competence of Aedes aegypti and Anopheles quadrimaculatus for Mayaro virus, Culex quinquefasciatus for West Nile virus, Aedes triseriatus for La Crosse virus, and Aedes aegypti for Oropouche virus (OROV). Female mosquitoes were fed BMs containing these viruses and half of them were given a second noninfectious BM at 3 or 4-days post infection. Mosquitoes were harvested at various time points and assayed for virus infection in bodies and disseminated infection in legs by performing reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays., RESULTS: We found that a second noninfectious BM had no impact on midgut infection rates but increased virus dissemination for all but one of the virus-vector pairings- Ae. aegypti and OROV. Unlike the other arboviruses under consideration, which are strictly mosquito-borne, biting midges (Culicoides spp.) serve as the main vector of OROV and this virus rarely disseminated to the mosquito leg tissue in our study., CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our findings show that sequential blood feeding enhances virus dissemination across diverse arbovirus-vector pairings, representing three mosquito genera and virus families, but a second BM was insufficient to overcome a strong midgut virus escape barrier in a nonnatural virus-vector pairing.

We aimed to identify risk predictors of and areas at risk for OROV transmission., METHODS: In this multidisciplinary, laboratory-based, modelling study, we retrospectively tested anonymised serum samples collected between 2001 and 2022 for studies on virus epidemiology and medical diagnostics in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Peru with nucleoprotein-based commercial ELISAs for OROV-specific IgG and IgM antibodies. Serum samples positive for IgG from different ecological regions and sampling years were tested against Guaroa virus and two OROV glycoprotein reassortants (Iquitos virus and Madre de Dios virus) via plaque reduction neutralisation testing (PRNT) to validate IgG ELISA specificity and support antigenic cartography. Three OROV strains were included in the neutralisation testing, a Cuban OROV isolate from the 2023-24 outbreak, a contemporary Peruvian OROV isolate taken from a patient in 2020, and a historical OROV isolate from Brazil. We analysed the serological data alongside age, sex, cohort, and geographical residence data for the serum samples; reported OROV incidence data; and vector occurrence data to explore OROV transmission in ecologically different regions of Latin America. We used the MaxEnt machine learning methodology to spatially analyse and predict OROV infection risk across Latin America, fitting one model with presence-absence serological data (seropositive results were recorded as presence and seronegative results were recorded as absence) and one model with presence-only, reported incidence data from 2024. We computed marginal dependency plots, variable contribution, and permutation metrics to analyse the impact of socioecological predictors and fitted a generalised linear mixed-effects model with logit link and binary error structure to analyse the potential effects of age, sex, or cohort type bias and interactions between age or sex and cohort type in our serological data. We conducted antigenic cartography and evolutionary characterisations of all available genomic sequences for all three OROV genome segments from the National Center for Biotechnology Information, including branch-specific selection pressure analysis and the construction of OROV phylogenetic trees., FINDINGS: In total, 9420 serum samples were included in this study, representing 76 provinces in the six Latin American countries previously mentioned. The sex distribution across the combined cohorts was 48% female (4237 of 8910 samples with available data) and 52% male (4673 of 8910 samples) and the mean age was 29.5 years (range 0-95 years). The samples were collected from census-based cohorts, cohorts of healthy individuals, and cohorts of febrile patients receiving routine health care. The average OROV IgG antibody detection rate was 6.3% (95% CI 5.8-6.8), with substantial regional heterogeneity. The presence-absence, serology-based model predicted high-risk areas for OROV transmission in the Amazon River basin, around the coastal and southern areas of Brazil, and in parts of central America and the Caribbean islands, consistent with case data from the 2023-24 outbreak reported by the Pan American Health Organization. Areas with a high predicted risk of OROV transmission with the serology-based model showed a statistically significant positive correlation with state-level incidence rates per 100 000 people in 2024 (generalised linear model, p=0.0003). The area under the curve estimates were 0.79 (95% CI 0.78-0.80) for the serology-based model and 0.66 (95% CI 0.65-0.66) for the presence-only incidence-based model. Longitudinal diagnostic testing of serum samples from cohorts of febrile patients suggested constant circulation of OROV in endemic regions at varying intensity. Climate variables accounted for more than 60% of variable contribution in both the serology-based and incidence-based models. Antigenic cartography, evolutionary analyses, and in-vitro growth comparisons showed clear differentiation between OROV and its glycoprotein reassortants, but not between the three different OROV strains. PRNT titres of OROV-neutralising serum samples were strongly correlated between all three tested OROV isolates (r>0.83; p<0.0001) but were not correlated with the two glycoprotein reassortants., INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest that climatic factors are major drivers of OROV spread and were potentially exacerbated during 2024 by extreme weather events. OROV glycoprotein reassortants, but not individual OROV strains, probably have distinct antigenicity. Preparedness for OROV outbreaks requires enhanced diagnostics, surveillance, and vector control in current and future endemic areas, which could all be informed by the risk predictions presented in this Article., FUNDING: European Union., TRANSLATIONS: For the Spanish and Portuguese translations of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.

Reports of its outbreak in Brazil have so far been restricted to the Central-Northern region of the country. However, its incidence is underestimated, mainly due to its clinical similarities with other arbovirus diseases, including dengue (DENV), chikungunya (CHIKV), and zika (ZIKV), and the lack of specific diagnostic tests. Here, we report for the first time, the detection of OROV in saliva and urine samples, and cases of autochthone OROV infections in Salvador Metropolitan region, Bahia, a Northeastern capital in the coast of Brazil. Serum, saliva, and urine samples negative for DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV were tested for OROV using a reverse transcription nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nested-PCR) protocol, and 2 serum, 2 saliva, and 1 urine samples were positive. This report shows the need for an efficient surveillance system for controlling the spread of this virus, and suggests the use of saliva and urine as alternative samples for OROV detection in the absence of serum samples.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fonseca Larissa Moraes Dos Santos; Carvalho Rejane Hughes; Bandeira Antonio Carlos; Sardi Silvia Ines; Campos Gubio Soares; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBrazil/ep [Epidemiology]\r\n*Bunyaviridae Infections/di [Diagnosis]\r\nBunyaviridae Infections/ep [Epidemiology]\r\n*Bunyaviridae Infections/ur [Urine]\r\nCeratopogonidae/vi [Virology]\r\nDisease Outbreaks\r\n*Fever/vi [Virology]\r\nHumans\r\n*Orthobunyavirus/ge [Genetics]\r\nOrthobunyavirus/ip [Isolation & Purification]\r\nRNA, Viral/ge [Genetics]\r\n*Saliva/vi [Virology]","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fonseca Larissa Moraes Dos Santos, Carvalho Rejane Hughes, Bandeira Antonio Carlos, Sardi Silvia Ines, and Campos Gubio Soares (2020) Oropouche Virus Detection in Febrile Patients' Saliva and Urine Samples in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil.

Despite the public health relevance, little is know about the geographic distribution, relative impact, and risk factors for arbovirus infection in many regions of the world. Our objectives were to describe the arboviruses associated with acute undifferentiated febrile illness in participating clinics in four countries in South America and to provide detailed epidemiological analysis of arbovirus infection in Iquitos, Peru, where more extensive monitoring was conducted., METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS: A clinic-based syndromic surveillance system was implemented in 13 locations in Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and Paraguay. Serum samples and demographic information were collected from febrile participants reporting to local health clinics or hospitals. Acute-phase sera were tested for viral infection by immunofluorescence assay or RT-PCR, while acute- and convalescent-phase sera were tested for pathogen-specific IgM by ELISA. Between May 2000 and December 2007, 20,880 participants were included in the study, with evidence for recent arbovirus infection detected for 6,793 (32.5%). Dengue viruses (Flavivirus) were the most common arbovirus infections, totaling 26.0% of febrile episodes, with DENV-3 as the most common serotype. Alphavirus (Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus [VEEV] and Mayaro virus [MAYV]) and Orthobunyavirus (Oropouche virus [OROV], Group C viruses, and Guaroa virus) infections were both observed in approximately 3% of febrile episodes. In Iquitos, risk factors for VEEV and MAYV infection included being male and reporting to a rural (vs urban) clinic. In contrast, OROV infection was similar between sexes and type of clinic., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data provide a better understanding of the geographic range of arboviruses in South America and highlight the diversity of pathogens in circulation. These arboviruses are currently significant causes of human illness in endemic regions but also have potential for further expansion. Our data provide a basis for analyzing changes in their ecology and epidemiology.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Forshey Brett M; Guevara Carolina; Laguna-Torres V Alberto; Cespedes Manuel; Vargas Jorge; Gianella Alberto; Vallejo Efrain; Madrid Cesar; Aguayo Nicolas; Gotuzzo Eduardo; Suarez Victor; Morales Ana Maria; Beingolea Luis; Reyes Nora; Perez Juan; Negrete Monica; Rocha Claudio; Morrison Amy C; Russell Kevin L; Blair Patrick J; Olson James G; Kochel Tadeusz J; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nAntibodies, Viral/bl [Blood]\r\n*Arbovirus Infections/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nArbovirus Infections/pa [Pathology]\r\n*Arbovirus Infections/vi [Virology]\r\n*Arboviruses/cl [Classification]\r\nArboviruses/ip [Isolation & Purification]\r\nChild\r\nChild, Preschool\r\nEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay\r\nFemale\r\n*Fever of Unknown Origin/ep [Epidemiology]\r\n*Fever of Unknown Origin/et [Etiology]\r\nFluorescent Antibody Technique, Direct\r\nHumans\r\nImmunoglobulin M/bl [Blood]\r\nInfant\r\nInfant, Newborn\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPrevalence\r\nReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction\r\nSouth America/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Forshey Brett M, Guevara Carolina, Laguna-Torres V Alberto, Cespedes Manuel, Vargas Jorge, Gianella Alberto, Vallejo Efrain, Madrid Cesar, Aguayo Nicolas, Gotuzzo Eduardo, Suarez Victor, Morales Ana Maria, Beingolea Luis, Reyes Nora, Perez Juan, Negrete Monica, Rocha Claudio, Morrison Amy C, Russell Kevin L, Blair Patrick J, Olson James G, and Kochel Tadeusz J (2010) Arboviral etiologies of acute febrile illnesses in Western South America, 2000-2007.

Ten localities were affected, including Belem, the capital of the State. Oropouche virus was isolated from 62 febrile patients, 31 of whom were residents of the town of Santa Izabel, which is located 40 km east of Belem. The first cases were diagnosed in Santa Izabel early in March; the outbreak, however, probably began in January. With the exception of Ananindeua where the epidemic was recognized only in November of 1979, the other localities were affected from March to July. A follow-up study undertaken from March to June in Santa Izabel, involving 97 families with 537 persons, revealed that the least 63% (49/78) of persons infected developed clinical manifestations. Serological tests showed that the incidence of the infection in 7 of the localities varied from 4.8% to 50.8% and that some 27, 253 persons were infected. This is a low estimate since only 6 districts of Belem were examined, and no estimate was for 3 of the affected localities. All age groups were infected, although the incidence was higher among the younger groups. Infection was slightly more common in female than males. The serological studies revealed that Oropouche virus had occurred in the past in all 7 localities, although the virus was only recorded previously from Belem where two epidemics were documented in 1961 and 1968. One strain of Oropouche virus was recovered from 21, 174 Culicoides paraensis collected in Belem, Santa Izabel and Ananindeua during the epidemic period; the isolate was obtained from the 5045 biting midges caught in Belem. No agent was recovered from 4740 Culex quinquefasciatus, or from 271 mosquitoes of other species examined. Antibodies to Oropouche virus were found in 2, 3% (3/126) of wild birds captured in the Santa Izabel area, but the 81 bats from the same locality were negative. It is probable that the introduction of Oropouche virus into the urban areas in 1979 originated from Tome-Acu, where an epidemic occurred the year before.\".","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Freitas R B; Pinheiro F P; Santos M A.

Although isolated in 1950's, still there is scarce information regarding the virus biology and its prevalence is likely underestimated. In order to identify and elucidate interactions with host cells factors and increase the understanding about the Oropouche Virus biology, we performed microRNA (miRNA) and target genes screening in human hepatocarcinoma cell line HuH-7. Cellular miRNAs are short non-coding RNAs that regulates gene expression post-transcriptionally and play key roles in several steps of viral infections. The large scale RT-qPCR based screening found 13 differentially expressed miRNAs in Oropouche infected cells. Further validation confirmed that miR-217 and miR-576-3p were 5.5 fold up-regulated at early stages of virus infection (6 hours post-infection). Using bioinformatics and pathway enrichment analysis, we predicted the cellular targets genes for miR-217 and miR-576-3p. Differential expression analysis of RNA from 95 selected targets revealed genes involved in innate immunity modulation, viral release and neurological disorder outcomes. Further analysis revealed the gene of decapping protein 2 (DCP2), a previous known restriction factor for bunyaviruses transcription, as a miR-217 candidate target that is progressively down-regulated during Oropouche infection. Our analysis also showed that activators genes involved in innate immune response through IFN-beta pathway, as STING (Stimulator of Interferon Genes) and TRAF3 (TNF-Receptor Associated Factor 3), were down-regulated as the infection progress. Inhibition of miR-217 or miR-576-3p restricts OROV replication, decreasing viral RNA (up to 8.3 fold) and virus titer (3 fold). Finally, we showed that virus escape IFN-beta mediated immune response increasing the levels of cellular miR-576-3p resulting in a decreasing of its partners STING and TRAF3. We concluded stating that the present study, the first for a Peribunyaviridae member, gives insights in its prospective pathways that could help to understand virus biology, interactions with host cells and pathogenesis, suggesting that the virus escapes the antiviral cellular pathways increasing the expression of cognates miRNAs.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Geddes Victor Emmanuel Viana; de Oliveira Anibal Silva; Tanuri Amilcar; Arruda Eurico; Ribeiro-Alves Marcelo; Aguiar Renato Santana; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Bunyaviridae Infections/ge [Genetics]\r\n*Bunyaviridae Infections/me [Metabolism]\r\nBunyaviridae Infections/vi [Virology]\r\nCell Line\r\nComputational Biology\r\nGene Expression Profiling\r\nHost-Pathogen Interactions\r\nHumans\r\nMicroRNAs/ge [Genetics]\r\n*MicroRNAs/me [Metabolism]\r\nOrthobunyavirus/ge [Genetics]\r\n*Orthobunyavirus/ph [Physiology]\r\n*Proviruses/ge [Genetics]\r\nProviruses/ph [Physiology]\r\nVirus Replication","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Geddes Victor Emmanuel Viana, de Oliveira Anibal Silva, Tanuri Amilcar, Arruda Eurico, Ribeiro-Alves Marcelo, and Aguiar Renato Santana (2018) MicroRNA and cellular targets profiling reveal miR-217 and miR-576-3p as proviral factors during Oropouche infection.

Although generally associated with moderate febrile illness, in more severe cases they can lead to neurological outcomes, such as encephalitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, and Congenital Syndromes. In this context astrocytes play a central role in production of inflammatory cytokines, regulation of extracellular matrix, and control of glutamate driven neurotoxicity in the central nervous system. Here, we presented a comprehensive genome-wide transcriptome analysis of human primary astrocytes infected with Chikungunya, Mayaro, Oropouche, or Zika viruses. Analyses of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), pathway enrichment, and interactomes have shown that Alphaviruses up-regulated genes related to elastic fiber formation and N-glycosylation of glycoproteins, with down-regulation of cell cycle and DNA stability and chromosome maintenance genes. In contrast, Oropouche virus up-regulated cell cycle and DNA maintenance and condensation pathways while down-regulated extracellular matrix, collagen metabolism, glutamate and ion transporters pathways. Zika virus infection only up-regulated eukaryotic translation machinery while down-regulated interferon pathways. Reactome and integration analysis revealed a common signature in down-regulation of innate immune response, antiviral response, and inflammatory cytokines associated to interferon pathway for all arboviruses tested. Validation of interferon stimulated genes by reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) corroborated our transcriptome findings. Altogether, our results showed a co-evolution in the mechanisms involved in the escape of arboviruses to antiviral immune response mediated by the interferon (IFN) pathway.

In particular, the outbreaks of Dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus, and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) have been explosive and unpredictable, and have led to significant adverse health effects. These viruses are considered the leading cause of acute undifferentiated febrile illnesses in Colombia. However, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is endemic in Colombia, and arboviruses such as the Mayaro virus (MAYV) and the Oropouche virus (OROV) cause febrile illnesses in neighboring countries. Yet, evidence of human exposure to MAYV and OROV in Colombia is scarce. In this study, we conducted a serosurvey study in healthy individuals from the Cauca Department in Colombia. We assessed the seroprevalence of antibodies against multiple arboviruses, including DENV serotype 2, CHIKV, VEEV, MAYV, and OROV. Based on serological analyses, we found that the overall seroprevalence for DENV serotype 2 was 30%, 1% for MAYV, 2.6% for CHIKV, 4.4% for VEEV, and 2% for OROV. This study provides evidence about the circulation of MAYV and OROV in Colombia, and suggests that they-along with VEEV and CHIKV-might be responsible for cases of acute undifferentiated febrile illnesses that remain undiagnosed in the region. The study results also highlight the need to strengthen surveillance programs to identify outbreaks caused by these and other vector-borne pathogens.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gil-Mora Juliana; Acevedo-Gutierrez L Yoana; Betancourt-Ruiz Paola L; Martinez-Diaz Heidy C; Fernandez Diana; Bopp Nathen E; Olaya-Masmela Luz A; Bolanos Eliana; Benavides Efrain; Villasante-Tezanos Alejandro; Hidalgo Marylin; Aguilar Patricia V; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Humans\r\n*Arboviruses\r\nSeroepidemiologic Studies\r\nColombia/ep [Epidemiology]\r\n*Chikungunya virus\r\n*Zika Virus\r\n*Chikungunya Fever\r\nAntibodies, Viral\r\nZika Virus Infection/ep [Epidemiology]\r\n*Zika Virus Infection\r\nFever","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gil-Mora Juliana, Acevedo-Gutierrez L Yoana, Betancourt-Ruiz Paola L, Martinez-Diaz Heidy C, Fernandez Diana, Bopp Nathen E, Olaya-Masmela Luz A, Bolanos Eliana, Benavides Efrain, Villasante-Tezanos Alejandro, Hidalgo Marylin, and Aguilar Patricia V (2022) Arbovirus Antibody Seroprevalence in the Human Population from Cauca, Colombia.

The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of arboviruses and other infectious causes of skin rash in a tertiary health unit in Manaus, Amazonas state, Western Brazilian Amazon., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This was a cross-sectional study of patients presenting with rash who sought care at Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Dr. Heitor Vieira Dourado (FMT-HVD) from February 2018 to May 2019. Individuals of either gender, aged over 18 years, were invited to participate voluntarily. Infection by Zika virus (ZIKV), dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Mayaro virus (MAYV), Oropouche virus (OROV) and measles was evaluated using RT-qPCR (real-time polymerase chain reaction). Immunodiagnostic tests for EBV, CMV, HIV, syphilis, rubella and measles were also performed. A total of 340 participants were included, most were female (228, 67.1%) with an average age of 36.5 years (SD +/- 12.2 years). The highest prevalence was of ZIKV monoinfections (65.3%, 222/340), followed by DENV (0.9%, 3/340) and CHIKV infection (0.3%, 1/340). No cases of MAYV, OROV or rubella were found. Other causes of skin rash were detected: measles (2.9%, 10/340), parvovirus B19 (0.9% 3/340), HIV (0.3%, 1/340) and syphilis 0.6% (2/340). The co-infections identified were ZIKV+HIV (0.3%, 1/340), ZIKV+measles (0.3%, 1/340), ZIKV+parvovirus B19 (0.3%, 1/340), ZIKV+EBV (0.3%, 1/340), EBV+parvovirus B19 (0.3%, 1/340), CMV+parvovirus B19 (0.6%, 2/340), CMV+syphilis (0.3%, 1/340), ZIKV+EBV+parvovirus B19 (0.3%, 1/340) and CMV+EBV+parvovirus B19 (0.9%, 3/340). Approximately one quarter of patients had no defined cause for their skin rash (25.3%, 86/340)., CONCLUSIONS: Despite the benign clinical evolution of most of the diseases diagnosed in this series of cases, syndromic surveillance of diseases such as syphilis and HIV are of utmost importance. Periodic serosurveillance might also aid in evaluating the trends of endemic diseases and eventual outbreaks.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Goncalves Maciel; Luiz Henrique; Vieira da Rocha Neto, Cosmo; Ferreira Martins; Yasmin; de Azevedo Furtado Francielen; Cunha Teixeira; Pamela; Oliveira Dias; Maianne Yasmin; Batista Rodrigues; Yanka Karolinna; Ribeiro Piauilino; Isa Cristina; Damasceno Pinto; Sergio; Corte Alencar; Aline Cristiane; de Lima Gimaque Joao Bosco; Gomes Mourao; Maria Paula; Guimaraes Lacerda; Marcus Vinicius; da Costa Castilho Marcia; Botto-Menezes Camila; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adult\r\n*Arboviruses\r\nBrazil/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nChikungunya Fever/di [Diagnosis]\r\nChikungunya Fever/ep [Epidemiology]\r\n*Chikungunya Fever\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\n*Cytomegalovirus Infections\r\nDengue/di [Diagnosis]\r\nDengue/ep [Epidemiology]\r\n*Dengue\r\nExanthema/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nExanthema/et [Etiology]\r\n*Exanthema\r\nFemale\r\n*HIV Infections\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\n*Measles\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPrevalence\r\n*Rubella\r\n*Syphilis\r\n*Zika Virus\r\nZika Virus Infection/co [Complications]\r\nZika Virus Infection/di [Diagnosis]\r\nZika Virus Infection/ep [Epidemiology]\r\n*Zika Virus Infection","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Goncalves Maciel, Luiz Henrique, Vieira da Rocha Neto, Cosmo, Ferreira Martins, Yasmin, de Azevedo Furtado Francielen, Cunha Teixeira, Pamela, Oliveira Dias, Maianne Yasmin, Batista Rodrigues, Yanka Karolinna, Ribeiro Piauilino, Isa Cristina, Damasceno Pinto, Sergio, Corte Alencar, Aline Cristiane, de Lima Gimaque Joao Bosco, Gomes Mourao, Maria Paula, Guimaraes Lacerda, Marcus Vinicius, da Costa Castilho Marcia, and Botto-Menezes Camila (2022) Prevalence of arboviruses and other infectious causes of skin rash in patients treated at a tertiary health unit in the Brazilian Amazon.

The virus ecology has mostly restricted its occurrence to the Amazon biome; however, after a large 2023-24 OROV epidemic in the Brazilian Amazon region, outbreaks are being reported across Brazil and in other countries in Latin America. Here, we investigate the OROV spread outside Amazonia., METHODS: In this genomic and epidemiological study, OROV cases from January, 2023, to July, 2024, provided by the General Coordination of Public Health Laboratories of Brazil on Aug 1, 2024, were compared by geographical location (Amazon vs non-Amazon) and municipal population size, and a linear mixed model was employed to assess the relationship between agricultural area size and cases. OROV-positive samples from central laboratories of five non-Amazonian Brazilian states were sequenced using an amplicon-based approach. Bayesian phylogeographical analysis was performed with near full-length viral genomes, incorporating individual travel histories when relevant. The estimated dates of viral introductions in each sampled location were then contextualised with public epidemiological data., FINDINGS: Epidemic data show that outside the Amazon region, OROV cases frequency was 3.9-times higher in small municipalities than in large municipalities. The planted areas of some agricultural products, such as banana plantations, were positively correlated (r=0.39, p<0.0001) with OROV cases. The linear mixed model revealed that, besides banana, cassava also has larger (p<0.05) planted areas in municipalities with OROV cases when compared with those with no cases. The phylogenetic analysis of 32 new OROV genomes reconstructed multiple exportation events of the newly identified reassortant lineage from the Amazon to other Brazilian regions between January and March, 2024. At least three of the previously described OROV phylogenetic clades circulating in the Amazon were the source of viral introductions. Molecular clock analysis estimated that viral introductions happened from 50 days to 100 days before detecting the outbreaks in each state., INTERPRETATION: Our results confirm that the novel OROV reassortant lineage spread from the Amazon to other regions in early 2024, successfully establishing local transmission. The fact that outbreaks were observed in small municipalities, instead of large urban centres, suggests that local ecological conditions that are ideal for OROV vector occurrence, such as the banana plantation environment, might be important factors driving its spread in Brazil., FUNDING: DECIT, CNPq, FAPEAM, and Inova-Fiocruz., TRANSLATION: For the Portuguese translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.

Despite its public health significance, we lack high-throughput diagnostics, therapeutics, and a comprehensive knowledge of OROV biology. Reporter viruses are valuable tools to rapidly study virus dynamics and develop neutralization and antiviral screening assays. OROV is a tri-segmented bunyavirus, which makes generating a reporter virus challenging, as introducing foreign elements into the viral genome typically affects fitness. We previously demonstrated that the non-structural gene NSm on the OROV medium (M) segment is non-essential for replication in vitro. Taking advantage of this, we have now generated a recombinant OROV expressing fluorescent protein ZsGreen in place of NSm. This reporter OROV is both stable and pathogenic in IFNAR<ovid:sup>-/-</ovid:sup> mice and provides a powerful tool for OROV pathogenesis studies and assay development.IMPORTANCEEmerging and reemerging infectious agents such as zoonotic bunyaviruses are of global health concern. Oropouche virus (OROV) causes recurring outbreaks of acute febrile illness in the Central and South American human populations. Biting midges are the primary transmission vectors, whereas sloths and non-human primates are their reservoir hosts. As global temperatures increase, we will likely see an expansion in arthropod-borne pathogens such as OROV. Therefore, developing reagents to study pathogen biology to aid in identifying druggable targets is essential. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility and use of a fluorescent OROV reporter in mice to study viral dynamics and pathogenesis. We show that this reporter OROV maintains characteristics such as growth and pathogenicity similar to the wild-type virus. Using this reporter virus, we can now develop methods to assist OROV studies and establish various high-throughput assays.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gunter Krista; Omoga Dorcus; Bowen James M; Gonzalez Lorimar Robledo; Severt Sydney; Davis Mackenzie; Szymanski Megan; Sandusky George; Duprex W Paul; Tilston-Lunel Natasha L; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Animals\r\nOrthobunyavirus/ge [Genetics]\r\nOrthobunyavirus/py [Pathogenicity]\r\n*Orthobunyavirus\r\nMice\r\nBunyaviridae Infections/vi [Virology]\r\n*Bunyaviridae Infections\r\n*Genes, Reporter\r\nVirus Replication\r\nHumans\r\nGreen Fluorescent Proteins/ge [Genetics]\r\nGreen Fluorescent Proteins/me [Metabolism]\r\nReceptor, Interferon alpha-beta/ge [Genetics]\r\nReceptor, Interferon alpha-beta/me [Metabolism]\r\nViral Nonstructural Proteins/ge [Genetics]\r\nViral Nonstructural Proteins/me [Metabolism]\r\nMice, Knockout","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gunter Krista, Omoga Dorcus, Bowen James M, Gonzalez Lorimar Robledo, Severt Sydney, Davis Mackenzie, Szymanski Megan, Sandusky George, Duprex W Paul, and Tilston-Lunel Natasha L (2024) A reporter Oropouche virus expressing ZsGreen from the M segment enables pathogenesis studies in mice.

Among these, Oropouche orthobunyavirus (OROV) is a relatively understudied member of the genus Orthobunyavirus, family Peribunyaviridae, that causes periodic outbreaks in human populations in Brazil and other South American countries. Although several studies have described the genetic diversity of the virus, the evolutionary processes that shape the OROV genome remain poorly understood. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the genomic dynamics of OROV that encompasses phylogenetic analysis, evolutionary rate estimates, inference of natural selective pressures, recombination and reassortment, and structural analysis of OROV variants. Our study includes all available published sequences, as well as a set of new OROV genome sequences obtained from patients in Ecuador, representing the first set of genomes from this country. Our results show differing evolutionary processes on the three segments that comprise the viral genome. We infer differing times of the most recent common ancestors of the genome segments and propose that this can be explained by cryptic reassortment. We also present the discovery of previously unobserved putative N-linked glycosylation sites, as well as codons that evolve under positive selection on the viral surface proteins, and discuss the potential role of these features in the evolution of OROV through a combined phylogenetic and structural approach. IMPORTANCE The emergence and reemergence of pathogens such as Zika virus, chikungunya virus, and yellow fever virus have drawn attention toward other cocirculating arboviruses in South America. Oropouche virus (OROV) is a poorly studied pathogen responsible for over a dozen outbreaks since the early 1960s and represents a public health burden to countries such as Brazil, Panama, and Peru. OROV is likely underreported since its symptomatology can be easily confounded with other febrile illnesses (e.g., dengue fever and leptospirosis) and point-of-care testing for the virus is still uncommon. With limited data, there is a need to optimize the information currently available. Analysis of OROV genomes can help us understand how the virus circulates in nature and can reveal the evolutionary forces that shape the genetic diversity of the virus, which has implications for molecular diagnostics and the design of potential vaccines.

Currently, sample processing and RNA extraction are costly and rely on proprietary materials that are difficult to acquire, maintain, and safely discard in low-resource settings. We developed an economical RNA extraction and storage protocol that eliminates the use of instrumentation, expensive materials, and cold chain requirements. Through an iterative process, we optimized viral lysis and RNA binding to and elution from glass fiber membranes. Protocol changes were evaluated by testing eluates in virus-specific real-time RT-PCRs (rRT-PCRs). Efficient, nontoxic viral lysis was achieved with a sucrose buffer including KCl, proteinase K and carrier RNA. Glass fiber membranes demonstrated concentration-dependent RNA binding of three arthropod-borne RNA viruses (arboviruses): dengue, chikungunya and Oropouche. Membrane binding was significantly increased in an acidic arginine binding buffer. For the clinical evaluation, 36 dengue virus (DENV)-positive serum samples were extracted in duplicate in the optimized protocol and results were compared to a commercial method. DENV RNA was successfully extracted from 71/72 replicates (98.6%) in the extraction packets, and rRT-PCR Ct values correlated between the techniques. Five clinical samples were selected to evaluate ambient-temperature storage up to 7 days on dried glass fiber membranes. DENV RNA was stable at 1, 3 and 7 days post extraction, with a mean difference in eluate RNA concentration of 0.14 log10 copies/microL. At a cost of $0.08/sample, RNA extraction and storage packets address key limitations to available protocols and may increase capacity for molecular detection of RNA viruses.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

This study evaluates the association between protective immunity from cross-reactive dengue antibodies with yellow fever infection and severity of the disease. The study population consisted of military personnel of a jungle garrison and its detachments located in the Ecuadorian Amazonian rainforest. The cross-sectional study employed interviews as well as seroepidemiological methods. Humoral immune response to yellow fever, Mayaro, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, Oropouche, and dengue 2 infections was assessed by evaluating IgM and IgG specific antibodies. Log-linear regression analysis was used to evaluate age and presence of antibodies, against dengue type 2 virus, as predictors of yellow fever infection or severe disease. During the seroepidemiological survey, presence of dengue antibodies among yellow fever cases were observed in 77.3% cases from the coastal region, where dengue is endemic, 14.3% cases from the Amazon and 16.7 % cases from the Andean region. Dengue cross-reactive antibodies were not significantly associated with yellow fever infection but significantly associated with severity of the disease. The findings of this study suggest that previous exposure to dengue infection may have induced an anamnestic immune response that did not prevent yellow fever infection but greatly reduced the severity of the disease.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Izurieta Ricardo O; Macaluso Maurizio; Watts Douglas M; Tesh Robert B; Guerra Bolivar; Cruz Ligia M; Galwankar Sagar; Vermund Sten H; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Izurieta Ricardo O, Macaluso Maurizio, Watts Douglas M, Tesh Robert B, Guerra Bolivar, Cruz Ligia M, Galwankar Sagar, and Vermund Sten H (2009) Anamnestic immune response to dengue and decreased severity of yellow Fever.

The Simbu serogroup of the genus Orthobunyavirus, family Bunyaviridae, is an example. The Simbu serogroup currently consists of a highly diverse group of related arboviruses that infect both humans and economically important livestock species. Here, we report complete genome sequences for 11 viruses within this group, with a focus on the large and poorly characterized Manzanilla and Oropouche species complexes. Phylogenetic and pairwise divergence analyses indicated the presence of high levels of genetic diversity within these two species complexes, on a par with that seen among the five other species complexes in the Simbu serogroup. Based on previously reported divergence thresholds between species, the data suggested that these two complexes should actually be divided into at least five species. Together these five species formed a distinct phylogenetic clade apart from the rest of the Simbu serogroup. Pairwise sequence divergences among viruses of this clade and viruses in other Simbu serogroup species complexes were similar to levels of divergence among the other orthobunyavirus serogroups. The genetic data also suggested relatively high levels of natural reassortment, with three potential reassortment events present, including two well-supported events involving viruses known to infect humans.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ladner Jason T; Savji Nazir; Lofts Loreen; Travassos da Rosa, Amelia; Wiley Michael R; Gestole Marie C; Rosen Gail E; Guzman Hilda; Vasconcelos Pedro F.

The haemagglutination-inhibition test (HI) was employed for 19 arbovirus of the Flavivirus,Alphavirus and Bunyavirus genus. Serum samples were tested from 1:20 to 1:1280 dilutions. Among the primates tested all C. flavius were negative and 46 percent C. libidinosus presented antibodies to arbovirus. Antibodies were detected for nine arbovirus (9/19). Seventeen heterotypic reactions were observed for at least two Or Flavirus and 15 for Alphavirus, at titers varying between 1:20 to 1:1280. Fifteen samples presented monotypic reaction for ILHV (n=4), MAYV (n=6), SLEV (n=1), ROCV (n=2), OROV (n=1) and MUCV (n=1).

None of these blood donors had fever or any other clinical sign of infection. Using different techniques, the samples were tested for the presence of Flavivirus, Alphavirus, DENV 1-3, yellow fever virus and Saint Louis encephalitis virus, DENV-4, Rocio virus, Iheus virus, West Nile virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Eastern equine encephalitis virus, Western equine encephalitis virus, Mayaro virus, and Oropouche virus. Results showed that despite the fact that 1220 PCR tests were performed in these samples covering about 15 different arboviruses, no arboviruses were detected. It is clear that the sample numbers should be increased, but the lack of detection of any arboviruses suggests that the possibility of transmission of these viruses without an epidemic of these diseases should not be clinically important.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lavezzo L C; Santana V dos S; Terzian A C.

As enveloped viruses, MAYV, SLEV, and OROV largely depend on their class II fusion proteins (E1, E, and Gc, respectively) for entry into the host cell. Since many aspects of the structural biology of such proteins remain unclear, the present study aimed at physicochemically characterizing them by an in silico approach. The complete amino acid sequences of MAYV E1, SLEV E, and OROV Gc proteins derived by conceptual translation from annotated coding regions in the reference sequence genome of the respective viruses were obtained from the NCBI Protein database in the FASTA format and then submitted to the ClustalO, Protcalc, Pepstats, Predator, Proscan, PCprof, Phyre2, and 3Drefine web servers for the determination of sequence identities, the estimation of residual properties, the prediction of secondary structures, the identification of potential post-translational modifications, the recognition of antigenic propensities, and the modeling/refinement of three-dimensional structures. Sequence identities were 20.44%, 18.82%, and 13.70% between MAYV/SLEV, SLEV/OROV, and MAYV/OROV fusion proteins, respectively. As for the residual properties, MAYV E1 and SLEV E proteins showed a predominance of the non-polar profile (56% and 55% of the residues, respectively), whereas the OROV Gc protein showed a predominance of the polar profile (52% of the residues). Regarding predicted secondary structures, MAYV E1 and SLEV E proteins showed fewer alpha-helices (16.51% and 15.17%, respectively) than beta-sheets (21.79% and 25.15%, respectively), while the opposite was observed in the OROV Gc protein (20.39% alpha-helices and 12.14% beta-sheets). Regarding post-translational modifications, MAYV E1, SLEV E, and OROV Gc proteins showed greater relative potential for protein kinase C phosphorylation, N-myristoylation, and casein kinase II phosphorylation, respectively. Finally, antigenic propensities were higher in the N-terminus half than in the C-terminus half of these three proteins, whose three-dimensional structures revealed three distinctive domains. In conclusion, MAYV E1 and SLEV E proteins were found to share more physicochemical characteristics with each other than the OROV Gc protein, although they are all grouped under the same class of viral fusion proteins.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Leal Crislaine S; Carvalho Carlos Alberto M; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Leal Crislaine S, and Carvalho Carlos Alberto M (2023) In Silico Physicochemical Characterization of Fusion Proteins from Emerging Amazonian Arboviruses.

For that, more than 10,000 peptide sequences from 5 Arbovirus and 8 different viral serotypes, namely Zika (ZIKV), Dengue (DENV serotypes 1-4), Chikungunya (CHIKV), Mayaro (MAYV) and Oropouche (OROV) viruses, in addition to YFV were analyzed. Haplotype HLA-A*02.01 was the dominant human MHC for all arboviruses. Over one thousand HLA-A2 immunogenic peptides were employed to build a comprehensive identity matrix. Intending to assess HLAA*02:01 reactivity of peptides in vitro, a peptide microarray was designed and generated using a dimeric protein containing HLA-A*02:01., Results: The comprehensive identity matrix allowed the identification of only three overlapping peptides between two or more flavivirus sequences, suggesting poor overlapping of virus-specific immunogenic peptides amongst arborviruses. Global analysis of the fluorescence intensity for peptide-HLA-A*02:01 binding indicated a dose-dependent effect in the array. Considering all assessed arboviruses, the number of DENV-derived peptides with HLA-A*02:01 reactivity was the highest. Furthermore, a lower number of YFV-17DD overlapping peptides presented reactivity when compared to non-overlapping peptides. In addition, the assessment of HLA-A*02:01-reactive peptides across virus polyproteins highlighted non-structural proteins as \"hot-spots\". Data analysis supported these findings showing the presence of major hydrophobic sites in the final segment of non-structural protein 1 throughout 2a (Ns2a) and in nonstructural proteins 2b (Ns2b), 4a (Ns4a) and 4b (Ns4b)., Discussion: To our knowledge, these results provide the most comprehensive and detailed snapshot of the immunodominant peptide signature for arbovirus with MHC-class I restriction, which may bring insight into the design of future virus-specific vaccines to arboviruses and for vaccination protocols in highly endemic areas.

However, few analyses have examined the associations between environmental factors and arboviral diseases. Thus, based on the hypothesis of correlation between environment and epidemiology, the proposals of this study were (1) to obtain the probability of occurrence of Oropouche, Mayaro, Saint Louis and Rocio fevers in Brazil based on environmental conditions corresponding to the periods of occurrence of the outbreaks; (2) to describe the macroclimatic scenario in Brazil in the last 50 years, evaluating if there was any detectable tendency to increase temperatures and (3) to model future expansion of those arboviruses in Brazil based on future temperature projections., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Our model assessed seven environmental factors (annual rainfall, annual temperature, elevation, seasonality of temperature, seasonality of precipitation, thermal amplitude, and daytime temperature variation) for their association with the occurrence of outbreaks in the last 50 years. Our results suggest that various environmental factors distinctly influence the distribution of each arbovirus, with temperature being the central determinant of disease distribution in all high-risk areas. These areas are subject to change, since the average temperature of some areas has increased significantly over the time., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first spatio-temporal study of the Oropouche, Mayaro, Saint Louis, and Rocio arboviruses, and our results indicate that they may become increasingly important public health problems in Brazil. Thus, next studies and control programs should include these diseases and also take into consideration key environmental elements.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lorenz Camila; Azevedo Thiago S; Virginio Flavia; Aguiar Breno S; Chiaravalloti-Neto Francisco; Suesdek Lincoln; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"*Arbovirus Infections/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nArboviruses/cl [Classification]\r\n*Arboviruses/ip [Isolation & Purification]\r\nBrazil/ep [Epidemiology]\r\n*Disease Outbreaks\r\n*Environmental Exposure\r\nHumans\r\nModels, Statistical\r\n*Neglected Diseases/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nSpatio-Temporal Analysis","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lorenz Camila, Azevedo Thiago S, Virginio Flavia, Aguiar Breno S, Chiaravalloti-Neto Francisco, and Suesdek Lincoln (2017) Impact of environmental factors on neglected emerging arboviral diseases.

OROV is transmitted by the midge Culicoides paraensis in both sylvatic and urban environments, and by the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus in urban settings. Reservoirs include mammals such as sloths, non-human primates, rodents, and birds. The clinical presentation of Oropouche fever resembles other arboviral infections, characterized by fever, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, and retro-orbital pain, with rare severe complications like hemorrhages and meningoencephalitis. Given the unprecedented spread of the virus, a prospective screening of travelers with compatible symptoms returning from endemic areas was conducted starting in May 2024. The screening included individuals who tested negative for common arboviruses (Chikungunya, Dengue, West Nile, and Zika) using molecular and serological tests. Plasma samples from 56 individuals, collected at Luigi Sacco hospital between January and May 2024, were tested using real-time PCR with previously described primers and probes, and FlexStarR LDT (RT-)PCR reagents.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mancon Alessandro; Gagliardi Gloria; Giacomelli Andrea; Vezzosi Luigi; Gori Andrea; Antinori Spinello; Cereda Danilo; Gismondo Maria Rita; Mileto Davide; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"chikungunya virus disease\r\nclinical aspects\r\ndengue\r\ndiagnosis\r\ndiagnostic techniques\r\ndisease vectors\r\nepidemics\r\nfever\r\nglobalization\r\nheadaches\r\nhuman diseases\r\ninfections\r\nmosquito-borne diseases\r\nmyalgia\r\nOropouche virus disease\r\nscreening\r\nskeletal muscle\r\nviral diseases\r\nWest Nile fever\r\nZika fever\r\nvectors","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mancon Alessandro, Gagliardi Gloria, Giacomelli Andrea, Vezzosi Luigi, Gori Andrea, Antinori Spinello, Cereda Danilo, Gismondo Maria Rita, and Mileto Davide (2024) Oropouche fever diagnosed in Milan, Italy in returning travellers from Rio de Janeiro, March 2024, and Cuba, July 2024.

In this study, we aimed to explore acylphloroglucinols and xanthohumol from hops (Humulus lupulus L.) as a promising alternative for antiviral therapies. The evaluation of the inhibitory potential of hops compounds on the viral cycle of OROV was performed through two complementary approaches. The first approach applies cell-based assay post-inoculation experiments to explore the inhibitory potential on the latest steps of the viral cycle, such as genome translation, replication, virion assembly, and virion release from the cells. The second part covers in silico methods evaluating the ability of those compounds to inhibit the activity of the endonuclease domain, which is essential for transcription, binding, and cleaving RNA. In conclusion, the beta acids showed strongest inhibitory potential in post-treatment assay (EC<ovid:sub>50</ovid:sub> = 26.7 microg/mL). Xanthohumol had the highest affinity for OROV endonuclease followed by colupulone and cohumulone. This result contrasts with that observed for docking and MM/PBSA analysis, where cohumulone was found to have a higher affinity. Finally, among the three tested ligands, Lys92 and Arg33 exhibited the highest affinity with the protein.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mandova Tsvetelina; Saivish Marielena Vogel; Menezes Gabriela de Lima; Bezerra Katyanna Sales; Fulco Umberto Laino; da Silva Roosevelt Alves; Da Costa Fernando Batista; Nogueira Mauricio Lacerda; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mandova Tsvetelina, Saivish Marielena Vogel, Menezes Gabriela de Lima, Bezerra Katyanna Sales, Fulco Umberto Laino, da Silva Roosevelt Alves, Da Costa Fernando Batista, and Nogueira Mauricio Lacerda (2023) Antiviral Activity and Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Hops Compounds against Oropouche Virus (Peribunyaviridae).

The aim of the study was to describe the clinical epidemiology of dengue in Manaus, the capital city of the state of the Amazonas, where all the four DENV serotypes were co-circulating simultaneously., METHODOLOGY: Patients with acute febrile illness during the 2011 outbreak of dengue, enrolled at the Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Dr. Heitor Viera Dourado (FMT-HVD), a referral centre for tropical and infectious diseases in Manaus, were invited to participate in a clinical and virological descriptive study. Sera from 677 patients were analyzed by RT-nested-PCRs for flaviviruses (DENV 1-4, Saint Louis encephalitis virus-SLEV, Bussuquara virus-BSQV and Ilheus virus-ILHV), alphavirus (Mayaro virus-MAYV) and orthobunyavirus (Oropouche virus-OROV)., PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Only dengue viruses were detected in 260 patients (38.4%). Thirteen patients were co-infected with more than one DENV serotype and six (46.1%) of them had a more severe clinical presentation of the disease.

We aimed to identify the neurological performance, disease-modifying therapies, and clinical outcomes related to patients with Oropouche-associated Guillain-Barre syndrome admitted to the critical care unit., METHODS: This was an analysis of 210 patients diagnosed with Guillain-Barre syndrome and suspicion of Oropouche viral infection admitted to the critical care units from June 2024 to September 2024 using the national administrative healthcare data. OROV was identified by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction. Patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome and Oropouche infection were compared with those without Oropouche infection in terms of demography features, neurological performance, disease-modifying therapies, and clinical outcomes., RESULTS: Most patients had a severe disease. Mechanical ventilation was required in 28.6%. Overall mortality rate was 14.3%. The median time from onset of weakness to intensive care unit discharge, and the median time from hospital admission to intensive care unit discharge was 18 days (IQR: 13-24.3 days) and 13 days (IQR: 9-19 days), respectively. Oropouche viral infection was detected in 43 (20.5%) patients. There were no differences among patients with and without Oropouche viral infection regarding general characteristics, neurological performance, disease-modifying therapies, and outcomes. After adjusting for confounders in multivariate logistic regression analysis, Oropouche viral infection (OR: 1.94; 95% CI: 0.72-5.20; p = 0.189) was not related to increased mortality., INTERPRETATION: Oropouche viral infection does not modify the clinical course, disease severity, and outcomes of patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome.

Oropouche virus is transmitted by numerous vectors, including multiple genera of mosquitoes and Culicoides biting midges in South America. This study investigated the vector competence of three North American vectors, Culex tarsalis, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Culicoides sonorensis, for OROV. Cohorts of each species were fed an infectious blood meal containing 6.5 log<ovid:sub>10</ovid:sub> PFU/mL OROV and incubated for 10 or 14 days. Culex tarsalis demonstrated infection (3.13%) but not dissemination or transmission potential at 10 days post infection (DPI). At 10 and 14 DPI, Cx. quinquefasciatus demonstrated 9.71% and 19.3% infection, 2.91% and 1.23% dissemination, and 0.97% and 0.82% transmission potential, respectively. Culicoides sonorensis demonstrated 86.63% infection, 83.14% dissemination, and 19.77% transmission potential at 14 DPI. Based on these data, Cx. tarsalis is unlikely to be a competent vector for OROV. Culex quinquefasciatus demonstrated infection, dissemination, and transmission potential, although at relatively low rates. Culicoides sonorensis demonstrated high infection and dissemination but may have a salivary gland barrier to the virus. These data have implications for the spread of OROV in the event of a North American introduction.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"McGregor Bethany L; Connelly C Roxanne; Kenney Joan L; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v13020226","Keywords":"Animals\r\n*Bunyaviridae Infections/tm [Transmission]\r\n*Ceratopogonidae/vi [Virology]\r\n*Culex/vi [Virology]\r\n*Mosquito Vectors/vi [Virology]\r\nOrthobunyavirus/ph [Physiology]\r\nUnited States\r\nVector Borne Diseases/tm [Transmission]\r\nVector Borne Diseases/vi [Virology]","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"McGregor Bethany L, Connelly C Roxanne, and Kenney Joan L (2021) Infection, Dissemination, and Transmission Potential of North American Culex quinquefasciatus, Culex tarsalis, and Culicoides sonorensis for Oropouche Virus.

Blood samples were taken from 16 Hoffman's two-toed sloths (HTSs; Choloepus hoffmanni ) and 26 brown-throated sloths (BTSs; Bradypus variegatus ) over a 3-yr period. We used serologic assays to detect antibodies against 10 arboviruses previously described in sloths (St. Louis encephalitis [SLEV], Changuinola, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, Ilheus [ILHV], Oropouche, Mayaro, Utinga, Murutucu, Punta Toro, and vesicular stomatitis [VSV] viruses) and six arboviruses not described in sloths (Rio Grande, West Nile [WNV], eastern equine encephalitis, Piry, Munguba, and La Crosse viruses). Overall, 80% of sloths had detectable antibodies to SLEV, 67% had antibodies to ILHV, 32% to Punta Toro virus, 30% to Changuinola virus, 15% to WNV, 14% to VSV, 11% to Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, and 10% to Rio Grande virus. No samples had detectable antibodies to the remaining eight viruses. We found a significant increase in prevalence of antibody to VSV in HTSs between 2005 and 2007, and for WNV antibody between 2005 and 2006. We found no significant differences in the prevalences of antibodies to the sampled viruses between the two locations. Antibody prevalences were significantly higher in HTSs than in BTSs for SLEV in 2005. Antibody-positive results for ILHV were likely due to cross-reaction with SLEV. The novel finding of antibodies to Rio Grande virus in sloths could be due to cross-reaction with another phlebovirus. These findings might have implications for land management and domestic animal health. Due to the nature of the study, we could not determine whether sloths could represent amplification hosts for these viruses, or whether they were only exposed and could be used as sentinel species. Further studies are needed to fully characterize arboviral exposure in sloths.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Medlin Scott; Deardorff Eleanor R; Hanley Christopher S; Vergneau-Grosset Claire; Siudak-Campfield Asia; Dallwig Rebecca; da Rosa Amelia Travassos; Tesh Robert B; Martin Maria Pia; Weaver Scott C; Vaughan Christopher; Ramirez Oscar; Sladky Kurt K; Paul-Murphy Joanne; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.7589/2015-02-040","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAnimals, Domestic\r\n*Antibodies, Viral/an [Analysis]\r\n*Arboviruses/ip [Isolation & Purification]\r\nCosta Rica\r\n*Sloths/vi [Virology]","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Medlin Scott, Deardorff Eleanor R, Hanley Christopher S, Vergneau-Grosset Claire, Siudak-Campfield Asia, Dallwig Rebecca, da Rosa Amelia Travassos, Tesh Robert B, Martin Maria Pia, Weaver Scott C, Vaughan Christopher, Ramirez Oscar, Sladky Kurt K, and Paul-Murphy Joanne (2016) Serosurvey of selected arboviral pathogens in free-ranging, two-toed sloths (Choloepus hoffmanni) and three-toed sloths (Bradypus variegatus) in Costa Rica, 2005-07.

Serological evidence suggests vertical transmission of OROV may be responsible. OROV has not been studied in the context of pregnancy and has unknown ability to infect the relevant tissues of the maternal-fetal interface, which have anti-viral properties; therefore, the mechanisms of vertical transmission are unknown. We used polarized human trophoblast stem cell organoids and human placenta explants to demonstrate that OROV (BeAn19991) infects and replicates in human tissues of the maternal-fetal interface including chorionic villi and the microbial-resistant cell, syncytiotrophoblast. Viral replication is robust within the first 24 hours post infection, and tissues from earlier gestations may be more susceptible to infection. These data indicate tissues at the maternal-fetal interface are susceptible to OROV infection and may facilitate vertical transmission, leading to adverse pregnancy outcomes.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Oropouche fever is caused by Oropouche virus (OROV), an orthobunyavirus with a tri-segmented (-)ssRNA genome. A recent epidemic caused by a novel reassortant has seen the first recorded deaths from OROV infection and reports of vertical transmission, affecting individuals across a dramatically expanded geographical range. Despite its importance as an emerging pathogen, research into OROV infection is hampered by paucity of available tools for serology and molecular virology. We have purified high-quality recombinant OROV nucleoprotein and the spike region of the viral surface glycoprotein Gc. We have used these antigens in indirect ELISA to detect seroconversion following experimental infection of animals, confirming their antigenic authenticity. These antigens stimulate the production of high neutralizing antibody titres in animals, highlighting their promise as immunogens for vaccination. We generated nanobodies that recognize both recombinant and infection-derived OROV antigens and developed a sandwich ELISA assay that can detect OROV antigens in human clinical serum samples with high efficiency. We have also shown that recombinant nanobodies directed against OROV Gc spike can potently neutralise infection by both historical OROV strains and the newly emerged reassortant. These protein-based reagents will accelerate OROV research and highlight the utility of protein-based tools for future OROV vaccines and point-of-care diagnostic devices.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The incidence of reports of this virus is intrinsically favored by environmental conditions, in which such characteristics are related to the increase and distribution of the vector population to areas of human traffic. Moreover, there is a problem regarding the lack of diagnosis in Brazil that aggregates the success of the etiologic agent. Thus, by means of molecular techniques, we identified 27 positive cases of the OROV circulating in border locations in western Amazon, with 44.44% (12/27) of the cohort characterized as infected individuals with reported symptoms, mainly ranging from fever, myalgia, and back pain. Among the positive samples, it was possible to obtain a total of 48.14% (13/27) samples to analyze the S and M segments of Oropouche, which showed similarities among the Brazilian sequences. Thus, it was possible to verify the circulation of the OROV in Rondonia and border areas, in which the tracking of neglected arboviruses is necessary for the genomic surveillance of emerging and re-emerging viruses.IMPORTANCEThe western Amazon region is known for outbreaks of acute febrile illnesses, to which the lack of specific diagnostics for different pathogens hinders the management of patients in healthcare units. The Oropouche virus has already been recorded in the region in the 1990s. However, this is the first study, after this record, to perform the detection of individuals with acute febrile illness using a screening test to exclude Zika, dengue, and chikungunya, confirmed by sequencing the circulation of the virus in the state of Rondonia and border areas. We emphasize the importance of including diagnostics for viruses such as Oropouche, which suffers underreporting for years and is related to seasonal periods in Western Amazon locations, a factor that has a direct influence on public health in the region. In addition, we emphasize the importance of genomic surveillance in the elucidation of outbreaks that affect the resident population of these locations.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Moreira Hillquias Monteiro; Sgorlon Gabriella; Queiroz Jackson A.

The RT-PCR was done on the fluids of C6/36 cells infected with each of 21 bunyaviruses. The bunyaviruses studied, with the exception of Catu virus, produced amplicons having 700 to 1300 base pairs and probably contained the whole S RNA segment sequence. A nested PCR performed with these amplicons distinguished California and most Bunyamwera serogroup viruses from other bunyaviruses by use of BBC specific internal primers for the S RNA segment, and distinguished Simbu serogroup viruses from others by use of BS specific internal primers. The nested-PCR amplicons of Guaroa, Maguari, California encephalitis, Bunyamwera, and Oropouche viruses were sequenced. The sequences were aligned with previously known sequences of the S RNA segment of the same viruses, showing a high degree of homology and thus confirming the specific origin of these amplicons. The nested RT-PCR is suitable as a specific screening for most California and Bunyamwera serogroup and Simbu serogroup viruses depending on the use of BBC or BS internal primers. Oropouche virus is an important public health problem in Brazil and the nested PCR with BS primers could be used for the detection of this virus in tissue culture and mouse brain isolates as well as in clinical samples.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Moreli Marcos Lázaro; Aquino Victor Hugo; Figueiredo Luiz Tadeu M; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Moreli Marcos Lázaro, Aquino Victor Hugo, and Figueiredo Luiz Tadeu M (2001) Identification of Simbu, California and Bunyamwera serogroup bunyaviruses by nested RT-PCR.

Members of this genus are often associated with acute febrile illness in animals and humans. As part of a longterm study of the ecology of arboviruses in the Amazon basin of Peru, we have isolated over 60 orthobunyaviruses from mosquitoes. The identification of many of these isolates by fluorescent antibody assay has been confounded by the lack of specificity of many available reagents. Therefore, we initiated genetic characterization, based on the S and M genomic segments, of selected viral isolates. Based on comparisons of the nucleotide sequences of the nucleocapsid gene, Wyeomyia, a virus in the Bunyamwera group, was the most related Orthobunyavirus species. Within the nonstructural S (NSs) open reading frame of the S segment, we found four conserved stop codons for the Peruvian isolates. Detailed comparisons of Bunyamwera, Simbu viruses, Group C viruses, and California viruses revealed all four of these NSs stop codons only appeared in Wyeomyia and the Peruvian isolates, and Guaroa conserved one of these stop codons. Such an apparent obliteration of the native NSs protein has not been described. Analysis of partial M segment amino acid sequence supports the conclusion that the viruses in this study are members of an uncharacterized orthobunyavirus group.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mores Christopher N; Turell Michael J; Dyer Jessie; Rossi Cindi A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/vbz.2008.0030","Keywords":"Amino Acid Sequence\r\nAnimals\r\nBase Sequence\r\n*Bunyaviridae Infections/vi [Virology]\r\n*Culicidae/vi [Virology]\r\nHumans\r\nMolecular Sequence Data\r\n*Orthobunyavirus/cl [Classification]\r\n*Orthobunyavirus/ge [Genetics]\r\nOrthobunyavirus/ip [Isolation & Purification]\r\nPeru\r\n*Phylogeny\r\nRNA, Viral/ge [Genetics]\r\nSensitivity and Specificity\r\nSequence Alignment\r\nSequence Analysis, DNA\r\nViral Nonstructural Proteins/ge [Genetics]","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mores Christopher N, Turell Michael J, Dyer Jessie, and Rossi Cindi A (2009) Phylogenetic relationships among orthobunyaviruses isolated from mosquitoes captured in Peru.

The virus is spread to humans by infected biting midges and some mosquito species. Although infection typically causes a self-limited febrile illness, reports of two deaths in patients with Oropouche virus infection and vertical transmission associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes have raised concerns about the threat of this virus to human health. In addition to approximately 8,000 locally acquired cases in the Americas, travel-associated Oropouche virus disease cases have recently been identified in European travelers returning from Cuba and Brazil. As of August 16, 2024, a total of 21 Oropouche virus disease cases were identified among U.S. travelers returning from Cuba. Most patients initially experienced fever, myalgia, and headache, often with other symptoms including arthralgia, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, and rash. At least three patients had recurrent symptoms after the initial illness, a common characteristic of Oropouche virus disease. Clinicians and public health jurisdictions should be aware of the occurrence of Oropouche virus disease in U.S. travelers and request testing for suspected cases.

Within this family, Dengue virus is the most serious threat to public health, especially in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. Currently, there are no vaccines or specific antiviral drugs against Dengue virus or against most of the viruses of this family. Therefore, the development of vaccines and the discovery of therapeutic compounds against the medically most important flaviviruses remain a global public health priority. We previously showed that phospholipase A2 isolated from the venom of Crotalus durissus terrificus was able to inhibit Dengue virus and Yellow fever virus infection in Vero cells. Here, we present evidence that phospholipase A2 has a direct effect on Dengue virus particles, inducing a partial exposure of genomic RNA, which strongly suggests inhibition via the cleavage of glycerophospholipids at the virus lipid bilayer envelope. This cleavage might induce a disruption of the lipid bilayer that causes a destabilization of the E proteins on the virus surface, resulting in inactivation. We show by computational analysis that phospholipase A2 might gain access to the Dengue virus lipid bilayer through the pores found on each of the twenty 3-fold vertices of the E protein shell on the virus surface. In addition, phospholipase A2 is able to inactivate other enveloped viruses, highlighting its potential as a natural product lead for developing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Muller Vanessa Danielle; Soares Ricardo Oliveira; dos Santos-Junior; Nilton Nascimento; Trabuco Amanda Cristina; Cintra Adelia Cristina; Figueiredo Luiz Tadeu; Caliri Antonio; Sampaio Suely Vilela; Aquino Victor Hugo; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Muller Vanessa Danielle, Soares Ricardo Oliveira, dos Santos-Junior, Nilton Nascimento, Trabuco Amanda Cristina, Cintra Adelia Cristina, Figueiredo Luiz Tadeu, Caliri Antonio, Sampaio Suely Vilela, and Aquino Victor Hugo (2014) Phospholipase A2 Isolated from the Venom of Crotalus durissus terrificus Inactivates Dengue virus and Other Enveloped Viruses by Disrupting the Viral Envelope.

OROV is transmitted by wild mosquitoes species to sloths, rodents, monkeys and birds in sylvatic environment, and by midges (Culicoides paraensis and Culex quinquefasciatus) to man causing explosive outbreaks in urban locations. OROV infection causes dengue fever-like symptoms and in few cases, can cause clinical symptoms of aseptic meningitis. OROV contains a tripartite negative RNA genome encapsidated by the viral nucleocapsid protein (NP), which is essential for viral genome encapsidation, transcription and replication. Here, we reported the first study on the structural properties of a recombinant NP from human pathogen Oropouche virus (OROV-rNP). OROV-rNP was successfully expressed in E. coli in soluble form and purified using affinity and size-exclusion chromatographies. Purified OROV-rNP was analyzed using a series of biophysical tools and molecular modeling. The results showed that OROV-rNP formed stable oligomers in solution coupled with endogenous E. coli nucleic acids (RNA) of different sizes. Finally, electron microscopy revealed a total of eleven OROV-rNP oligomer classes with tetramers (42%) and pentamers (43%) the two main populations and minor amounts of other bigger oligomeric states, such as hexamers, heptamers or octamers. The different RNA sizes and nucleotide composition may explain the diversity of oligomer classes observed. Besides, structural differences among bunyaviruses NP can be used to help in the development of tools for specific diagnosis and epidemiological studies of this group of viruses.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Murillo Juliana Londono; Cabral Aline Diniz; Uehara Mabel; da Silva Viviam Moura; Dos Santos; Juliete Vitorino; Muniz Joao Renato Carvalho; Estrozi Leandro Farias; Fenel Daphna; Garcia Wanius; Speranca Marcia Aparecida; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-018-2560-4","Keywords":"*Genome, Viral\r\nHumans\r\n*Nucleoproteins/ch [Chemistry]\r\nNucleoproteins/ge [Genetics]\r\nNucleoproteins/me [Metabolism]\r\n*Protein Multimerization\r\n*RNA, Viral/ch [Chemistry]\r\nRNA, Viral/ge [Genetics]\r\nRNA, Viral/me [Metabolism]\r\n*Simbu virus/ch [Chemistry]\r\nSimbu virus/me [Metabolism]\r\n*Viral Proteins/ch [Chemistry]\r\nViral Proteins/ge [Genetics]\r\nViral Proteins/me [Metabolism]","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Murillo Juliana Londono, Cabral Aline Diniz, Uehara Mabel, da Silva Viviam Moura, Dos Santos, Juliete Vitorino, Muniz Joao Renato Carvalho, Estrozi Leandro Farias, Fenel Daphna, Garcia Wanius, and Speranca Marcia Aparecida (2018) Nucleoprotein from the unique human infecting Orthobunyavirus of Simbu serogroup (Oropouche virus) forms higher order oligomers in complex with nucleic acids in vitro.

One of the highlights is prevention, which includes the diagnosis and early treatment of diseases. The detection and classical identification of pathogens are based on microscopy and culture, however the low sensitivity; the need for trained professionals and adequate infrastructure leads, in some cases, to the failure of the diagnosis and in the delay to start treatment. Objective: to develop CEL, an equipment for LAMP (Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification) assays for use in low-resource settings laboratories. Results: Protocols were standardized for five important diseases found in the Amazon region: tuberculosis, malaria, dengue, mayaro and oropouche fevers. The equipment has integrated photometric detection, with the capacity of eight simultaneous reactions, detecting the color change observed in the positive reactions. The results are shown in an easy-to-read alphanumeric display, even for people with no experience with the technique. The results can also be transferred by bluetooth to a smartphone with the CEL App, where it is possible to see the results in a graphical interface. Conclusion: Once CEL is a low-cost device, developed for molecular diagnostics, it can represent an alternative to the expansion of the molecular diagnosis in the services of the primary health attention, allowing higher population access, even in remote areas.","Comments":"Do not use link to PDF for map: http://bvsms.saude.gov.br/bvs/periodicos/ccs_artigos/desenvolvimento_cel.pdf","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Naveca Felipe gomes; Nascimento Valdinete Alves do; Souza Victor Costa de; Santos Junior; Carlos Raimundo Pereira dos; Monteiro Dana Cristina da Silva; Silva Arlesson Viana da; Moura Thiago Daniel de Oliveira; Cardoso Valtemar Fernandes; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Diagnóstico molecular\r\nDiagnóstico diferencial\r\nTuberculose\r\nMalária\r\nArboviroses\r\nAmazônia\r\nMolecular diagnosis\r\nDifferential diagnosis\r\nTuberculosis\r\nMalaria\r\nArboviruses\r\nAmazon","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Naveca Felipe gomes, Nascimento Valdinete Alves do, Souza Victor Costa de, Santos Junior, Carlos Raimundo Pereira dos, Monteiro Dana Cristina da Silva, Silva Arlesson Viana da, Moura Thiago Daniel de Oliveira, and Cardoso Valtemar Fernandes (2017) Development of CEL: a low-cost equipment for Loop-mediated  Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assays.

A chimeric plasmid containing both Mayaro and Oropouche targets was designed and evaluated for the in vitro production of transcribed RNA, which could be easily used as a non-infectious external control. To track false-negative results due to PCR inhibition or equipment malfunction, the MS2 bacteriophage was also included in the multiplex assay as an internal positive control. The specificity of the multiplex assay was evaluated by Primer-Blast analysis against the entire GenBank database, and further against a panel of 17 RNA arboviruses. The results indicated an accurate and highly sensitive assay with amplification efficiency greater than 98% for both targets, and a limit of detection between two and 20 copies per reaction. We believe that the assay described here will provide a tool for Mayaro and Oropouche virus detection, especially in areas where differential diagnosis of Dengue, Zika and Chikungunya viruses should be performed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Naveca Felipe Gomes; Nascimento Valdinete Alves do; Souza Victor Costa de; Nunes Bruno Tardelli Diniz; Rodrigues Daniela Sueli Guerreiro; Vasconcelos Pedro Fernando da Costa; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1590/0074-02760160062","Keywords":"Alphavirus/cl [Classification]\r\n*Alphavirus/ge [Genetics]\r\n*Alphavirus Infections/di [Diagnosis]\r\nAlphavirus Infections/vi [Virology]\r\n*Bunyaviridae Infections/di [Diagnosis]\r\nBunyaviridae Infections/vi [Virology]\r\nHumans\r\nMultiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction\r\nOrthobunyavirus/cl [Classification]\r\n*Orthobunyavirus/ge [Genetics]\r\nReproducibility of Results\r\nReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction\r\nSensitivity and Specificity","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Naveca Felipe Gomes, Nascimento Valdinete Alves do, Souza Victor Costa de, Nunes Bruno Tardelli Diniz, Rodrigues Daniela Sueli Guerreiro, and Vasconcelos Pedro Fernando da Costa (2017) Multiplexed reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction for simultaneous detection of Mayaro, Oropouche, and Oropouche-like viruses.

Viral RNA extraction was performed, and specimens were tested for dengue virus using RT-PCR. Thirty dengue negative samples were further tested for Mayaro virus (MAYV) and Oropouche virus (OROV) using an RT-qPCR protocol previously described. Positive samples were characterized by MegaBLAST analysis over the entire nucleotide collection of the main public databases, and also by maximum likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction of the S genome segment., RESULTS: We detected nine OROV or OROV-like positive cases among 30 patients reporting fever and headache, as the most common symptoms. The closest nucleotide sequence returned from the MegaBLAST analysis belongs to an OROV isolated in Peru 2008. Moreover, all Tefe samples grouped in the same clade with the OROV reference sequence and other closely-related OROV-like viruses., DISCUSSION: Dengue viruses are still the most important arbovirus worldwide, causing hundreds of millions of infections every year. Nonetheless, other arboviruses like chikungunya virus, Zika virus, and yellow fever virus have emerged in the last few years and are now a public health concern in several countries. OROV is believed to have caused more than 500,000 febrile infections in Brazil over recent decades. Therefore, the results described in this study strengthen that this arbovirus, and its closely-related recombinants, should be under continuous surveillance, at least in the endemic countries of Latin America.","Comments":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/currents.outbreaks.7d65e5eb6ef75664da68905c5582f7f7","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Naveca Felipe Gomes; Nascimento Valdinete Alves; Souza Victor Costa; de Figueiredo Regina M.

In this study, we sequenced and analyzed 382 OROV genomes from human samples collected in Amazonas, Acre, Rondonia and Roraima states, between August 2022 and February 2024, to uncover the origin and genetic evolution of OROV in the current outbreak. Genomic analyses revealed that the upsurge of OROV cases in the Brazilian Amazon coincides with spread of a novel reassortant lineage containing the M segment of viruses detected in the eastern Amazon region (2009-2018) and the L and S segments of viruses detected in Peru, Colombia and Ecuador (2008-2021). The novel reassortant likely emerged in the Amazonas state between 2010 and 2014 and spread through long-range dispersion events during the second half of the 2010s. Phylodynamics reconstructions showed that the current OROV spread was driven mainly by short-range (< 2 km) movements consistent with the flight range of vectors. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion (22%) of long-range (>10 km) OROV migrations were also detected, consistent with viral dispersion by humans. Our data provide a view of the unprecedented spread and evolution of OROV in the Brazilian western Amazon region. Copyright &#xa9; 2024.

Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies to different arboviruses were detected, with monotypic reactions to MAYV and OROV, two important arboviruses associated with epidemics in the Amazon. IgM antibodies to OROV and MAYV were found in human sera, suggesting recent infections by these viruses. Two DENV-3 strains were isolated from febrile patients in Novo Progresso and identified as genotype III strains. In general, the data suggest that the area displays ideal conditions for maintenance and circulation of arboviruses, plus a population with low immunization levels. Dynamic surveillance of local immigrants and wild animals is thus important, focusing on antibody prevalence and isolation of arboviruses, thereby allowing effective control of infections by these viral agents in the resident population along highway BR-163 in Para State.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nunes Marcio Roberto Teixeira; Barbosa Taciana Fernandes Souza; Casseb Livia Medeiros Neves; Nunes Neto; Joaquim Pinto; Segura Nazare de Oliveira; Monteiro Hamilton Antonio de Oliveira; Pinto Eliana Vieira; Casseb Samir Mansour; Chiang Jannifer de Oliveira; Martins Livia Caricio; Medeiros Daniele Barbosa de Almeida; Vasconcelos Pedro Fernando da Costa; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAnimals\r\n*Antibodies, Viral/bl [Blood]\r\n*Arbovirus Infections/ep [Epidemiology]\r\n*Arbovirus Infections/ve [Veterinary]\r\nArbovirus Infections/vi [Virology]\r\n*Arboviruses/im [Immunology]\r\nArthropod Vectors/vi [Virology]\r\nBrazil/ep [Epidemiology]\r\n*Disease Outbreaks\r\nDisease Vectors\r\nEcosystem\r\n*Environmental Monitoring/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data]\r\nEpidemiological Monitoring\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nImmunoglobulin M/bl [Blood]\r\nMale\r\nSpecies Specificity\r\nUrbanization","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nunes Marcio Roberto Teixeira, Barbosa Taciana Fernandes Souza, Casseb Livia Medeiros Neves, Nunes Neto, Joaquim Pinto, Segura Nazare de Oliveira, Monteiro Hamilton Antonio de Oliveira, Pinto Eliana Vieira, Casseb Samir Mansour, Chiang Jannifer de Oliveira, Martins Livia Caricio, Medeiros Daniele Barbosa de Almeida, and Vasconcelos Pedro Fernando da Costa (2009) Arbovirus eco-epidemiology in the area affected by the Cuiaba-Santarem Highway (BR-163), Para State, Brazil.

This arbovirus is one of the most common causes of febrile illness in Brazil, and is responsible for several epidemics since 1960's. In this study, we sequenced and characterized the complete coding sequences (S-, M- and L-RNA) of 35 OROV isolates from Brazil. Here, we classified 20 strains in genotype I from Para and Maranhao states, nine as genotype II from Para and Rondonia states confirmed, four classified into genotype III from Acre, Maranhao, Minas Gerais and Rondonia states and two genotype IV from Amazonas State. Also, we did not observe reassortment events involving the OROV isolates. In addition, we developed novel RT-PCR tools to identify reassortment events among OROV strains. These data will be useful to better understand the molecular epidemiology and diagnostic of OROV infections. Copyright &#xa9; 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Periodic outbreaks have occurred since its description in 1955. In late 2023, an outbreak occurred in Peru, centered in and around Iquitos in the Eastern Peruvian Amazon. An existing acute febrile illness (AFI) surveillance program was able to document its emergence and characterize arthralgia and dysuria and the absence of diarrhea as distinctive clinical features of Oropouche virus-associated febrile illness relative to other causes of AFI. Sequencing of isolates from the outbreak demonstrated that strains from this region were distinct from those causing disease in Brazil, despite the large-scale movement of people along the Amazon corridor, but highly similar to strains from Colombia and Ecuador. Our findings suggest that the current outbreak in South America is fundamentally multifocal in origin and not the result of geographic spread from Brazil, which experienced an outbreak between 2022 and 2024.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Olortegui Maribel Paredes; Schiaffino Francesca; Penataro Yori; Pablo; Colston Josh M; Shapiama Lopez; Valentino; Pinedo Vasquez; Tackeshy; Garcia Bardales; Paul F; Flynn Thomas G; Ramal-Asayag Cesar; Hughes Holley R; Davis Emily; Russell Brandy J; Brault Aaron C; Palomino Yuri Alfonso Alegre; Munayco Cesar; Liu Jie; Houpt Eric; Cooper Kerry K; Parker Craig T; Kosek Margaret N; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2024.12.08.24318674","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Olortegui Maribel Paredes, Schiaffino Francesca, Penataro Yori, Pablo, Colston Josh M, Shapiama Lopez, Valentino, Pinedo Vasquez, Tackeshy, Garcia Bardales, Paul F, Flynn Thomas G, Ramal-Asayag Cesar, Hughes Holley R, Davis Emily, Russell Brandy J, Brault Aaron C, Palomino Yuri Alfonso Alegre, Munayco Cesar, Liu Jie, Houpt Eric, Cooper Kerry K, Parker Craig T, and Kosek Margaret N (2024) Genomic Epidemiology of 2023-2024 Oropouche Outbreak in Iquitos, Peru reveals independent origin from a concurrent outbreak in Brazil. medRxiv: the preprint server for health sciences ,  DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2024.12.08.24318674"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":17036613,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":17036565,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":17036601,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"Outcomes":[],"ItemId":109893544,"Title":"Jungle yellow fever in Goias, Brazil ","ParentTitle":"PAHO.

Various medically important flaviviruses and alphaviruses have been reported in domestic and wild animals in the region. To expand the knowledge of local arbovirus circulation, a serosurvey for 14 Brazilian orthobunyaviruses was conducted with equines, sheep and free-ranging caimans. Sera were tested for specific viral antibodies using plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Monotypic reactions were detected for Maguari, Xingu, Apeu, Guaroa, Murutucu, Oriboca, Oropouche and Nepuyo viruses. Despite the low titers for most of the orthobunyaviruses tested, the detection of monotypic reactions for eight orthobunyaviruses suggests the Pantanal as a region of great orthobunyavirus diversity. The present data, in conjunction with previous studies that detected a high diversity of other arboviruses, ratify the Pantanal as an important natural reservoir for sylvatic and medically important arboviruses in Brazil.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pauvolid-Correa Alex; Campos Zilca; Soares Raquel; Nogueira Rita Maria Ribeiro; Komar Nicholas; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0006014","Keywords":"Alligators and Crocodiles/vi [Virology]\r\n*Alligators and Crocodiles\r\nAnimals\r\nAnimals, Domestic/vi [Virology]\r\nAnimals, Wild/vi [Virology]\r\n*Antibodies, Neutralizing/bl [Blood]\r\n*Antibodies, Viral/bl [Blood]\r\nBrazil/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nBunyaviridae Infections/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nBunyaviridae Infections/im [Immunology]\r\n*Bunyaviridae Infections/ve [Veterinary]\r\nBunyaviridae Infections/vi [Virology]\r\n*Horse Diseases/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nHorse Diseases/im [Immunology]\r\nHorse Diseases/vi [Virology]\r\nHorses/vi [Virology]\r\n*Orthobunyavirus/im [Immunology]\r\nOrthobunyavirus/ip [Isolation & Purification]\r\nSeroepidemiologic Studies\r\nSheep/vi [Virology]\r\n*Sheep Diseases/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nSheep Diseases/im [Immunology]\r\nSheep Diseases/vi [Virology]","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pauvolid-Correa Alex, Campos Zilca, Soares Raquel, Nogueira Rita Maria Ribeiro, and Komar Nicholas (2017) Neutralizing antibodies for orthobunyaviruses in Pantanal, Brazil.

These infections may cause severe clinical outcomes, long lasting sequelae or death. Few studies have addressed viral neurological infections etiology in Brazil., OBJECTIVES: Identification of viruses in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of human neurological infections suspected of viral etiology during January and May 2019 in Midwestern Brazil., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical, laboratory and epidemiological information was gathered from medical records. In addition, an aliquot of the sampled CSF was subjected to viral RNA/DNA extraction, randomic dscDNA amplification by PCR, DNA purification and Ilumina HiSeq 2500 sequencing., RESULTS: Six viral genomes belonging to Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) East-Central-South African (ECSA) genotype (10.834-11.804 nt in length) confirmed lately by RT-PCR for CHIKV envelope were present in all six liquor samples. These genomes present two mutations, nsP2:T31I and nsP3:A388V, shared with other Mato Grosso State strains from 2019, not present in sequences of the virus from previous years obtained in the State. One case was a triple co-infection also confirmed through RT-PCR, with Dengue virus serotype 4 genotype II (NS5; 874 nt) and Oropouche virus genotype IA (segment S; 302 nt). CSF was clear and colorless (5/6 patients), with >10% of lymphomononuclear cells (6/6), 1-99 erythrocytes/mm<ovid:sup>3</ovid:sup> (5/6), glucose levels >50 mg/dl (4/5) e > 10 mg/dl of proteins (4/4). One patient evolved to death, and another, a newborn, presented sequelae after recovery., CONCLUSIONS: Despite herpesviruses and enteroviruses are frequent etiologies of neurological infections, the casuistic here reported was associated to arboviruses already known to be responsible for acute febrile illness outbreaks in the state of Mato Grosso, Midwestern Brazil.

Although mild symptoms generally occur, complications such as encephalitis and meningitis may develop. A lack of proper diagnosis, makes it a potential candidate for new epidemics and outbreaks like other known arboviruses such as Dengue, Yellow Fever and Zika virus. The study of natural molecules as potential antiviral compounds is a promising alternative for antiviral therapies. Wedelolactone (WDL) has been demonstrated to inhibit some viral proteins and virus replication, making it useful to target a wide range of viruses. In this study, we report the in silico effects of WDL on the OROV N-terminal polymerase and its potential inhibitory effects on several steps of viral infection in mammalian cells in vitro, which revealed that WDL indeed acts as a potential inhibitor molecule against OROV infection.

This virus is mainly circulating in Central and South America. In 2024 they have been reported an ongoing outbreak. Method(s): For this study, travelers returning from endemic areas with dengue-like symptoms and negative results for dengue from March to October 2024, were tested for Oropouche through RT-PCR. Result(s): Among 43 patients tested, we detected an imported case of Oropouche fever imported from Cuba in a traveler presenting biphasic fever and neurological symptoms. The virus was detected by RT-PCR in urine samples collected more than one month after the onset of symptoms, suggesting prolonged viral shedding and expanding the diagnostic period for molecular confirmation of the infection. Conclusion(s): Although only few cases have been yet reported in European travelers, the expansion of the virus in the Americas supports laboratory preparedness and clinical awareness.Copyright © 2025","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Peiro-Mestres A; Riera E; Flores Calderon; C; Navero-Castillejos J; Martinez M J; Camprubi-Ferrer D; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"adult\r\n*Arbovirus\r\narticle\r\nbunyavirus infection\r\nCuba\r\ndengue\r\ndiagnosis\r\nfever\r\nhuman\r\nmajor clinical study\r\nmale\r\nneurologic disease\r\nnonhuman\r\n*Oropouche virus\r\nSouth America\r\nurine sampling\r\nvirus shedding\r\nWestern Hemisphere","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Peiro-Mestres A, Riera E, Flores Calderon, C, Navero-Castillejos J, Martinez M J, and Camprubi-Ferrer D (2025) Emergence of Oropouche virus among international travelers: A growing concern in non-endemic areas.

This study determined the diversity and distribution of mosquitoes in forest environments in order to analyze the potential vectors of Amazonian forest arboviruses. Mosquitoes were collected by 1) vertical stratification from forest canopy and ground areas using Hooper Pugedo (HP) light traps and human attraction and 2) horizontal stratification using HP light traps in peridomicile, forest edge, and forest environments near the Rio Pardo rural settlement, Amazonas, Brazil. A total of 3,750 mosquitoes were collected, representing 46 species. 3,139 individuals representing 46 species were sampled by vertical stratification. Both the Shannon-Weaver diversity index (H') and equitability (J') were higher in the canopy than on the ground. 611 individuals representing 13 species were sampled by horizontal stratification. H' decreased in the following order: forest edge > forest > peridomicile, and J' was greater at the forest edge and smaller in the peridomicile environment. Moreover, H' was higher for the human attraction collection method than the HP traps. A total of 671 pools were analyzed by RT-qPCR; three species were positive for Oropouche-like viruses (Ochlerotatus serratus, Psorophora cingulata, and Haemagogus tropicalis) and the minimum infection rate was 0.8%. The composition of mosquito species did not differ significantly between anthropic and forest environments in Rio Pardo. Some mosquito species, due to their abundance, dispersion in the three environments, and record of natural infection, were hypothesized to participate in the arbovirus transmission cycle in this Amazonian rural settlement.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pereira-Silva Jordam William; Rios-Velasquez Claudia Maria; Lima Gervilane Ribeiro de; Marialva Dos Santos; Eric Fabricio; Belchior Heliana Christy Matos; Luz Sergio Luiz Bessa; Naveca Felipe Gomes; Pessoa Felipe Arley Costa; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246932","Keywords":"Animals\r\n*Arboviruses/ph [Physiology]\r\n*Biodiversity\r\nBrazil\r\nCulicidae/cl [Classification]\r\n*Culicidae/vi [Virology]\r\n*Forests\r\nHumans\r\n*Rural Population","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pereira-Silva Jordam William, Rios-Velasquez Claudia Maria, Lima Gervilane Ribeiro de, Marialva Dos Santos, Eric Fabricio, Belchior Heliana Christy Matos, Luz Sergio Luiz Bessa, Naveca Felipe Gomes, and Pessoa Felipe Arley Costa (2021) Distribution and diversity of mosquitoes and Oropouche-like virus infection rates in an Amazonian rural settlement.

Here, we report the first record of C. paraensis in Cuba, during the first known outbreak of Oropouche fever outside its endemic range in the Amazon region. Using human landing catches, we collected 98 specimens of C. paraensis in three Cuban provinces (Santiago de Cuba, Cienfuegos, and Havana), where Oropouche fever had been documented in humans. This species was not captured using various traps deployed at the sampling sites (BG-Sentinel, New Jersey traps, and CDC light traps), which may explain why C. paraensis had not been previously reported in Cuba. In North America, C. paraensis develops in wet treeholes, while in tropical regions, it uses cacao husks and banana stumps as larval habitats. However, the specific larval development sites for this species in Cuba are unknown. The capture of adult female C. paraensis in areas of active Oropouche virus circulation suggests their involvement in virus transmission in Cuba. Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

Recent imported cases to Europe and North America have raised concerns about the potential for local transmission in non-endemic areas. To assess this risk in the United Kingdom, we investigated the vector competence of Culex pipiens molestus (Cx. molestus), a human-biting mosquito common in urban environments. Laboratory-reared adult females were fed a bloodmeal containing a Cuban 2024 OROV outbreak strain (240023) and maintained at 27°C. Of 64 individuals tested at 12-s14 days post-infection via plaque assay, none were positive for OROV in bodies, indicating no evidence of infection and subsequently limited or no vector competence potential. These results provide evidence that UK populations of Cx. molestus are unlikely to support OROV transmission, thereby refining assessments of OROV emergence risk in temperate settings. Further studies are needed to test other putative UK mosquito vectors, as well as Culicoides biting midge species to fully assess the potential for OROV transmission in this region.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Health Protection Research Unit in Emerging and Zoonotic Infections at University of Liverpool, https://ror.org/05vvt7a66Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, https://ror.org/00cwqg982, BBS/E/PI/230002C, BBS/E/PI/23NB0004, BBS/E/PI/23NB0003","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pilgrim Jack; Sy Victoria E; Multeau Quentin; Komarasamy Thamil Vaani; Kohl Alain; Blagrove Marcus S.

One MAYV-positive sample with a negative result for all other viruses tested was identified and subsequently sequenced using the automated Sanger method and, through phylogenetic analysis, was characterized as belonging to genotype D, making it the first case of Mayaro in humans isolated in Rondonia. The symptoms reported by the positive patient were fever, vomiting, back pain, nausea, severe arthralgia, and retro-orbital pain.

The proposed basis for the activity against negative-sense RNA viruses is the binding to exposed 5'-triphosphates (5'-ppp) on the genome of viral RNA. However, recent studies reported relatively low binding affinities of IFIT1 for 5'-ppp RNA, suggesting that IFIT1 may not interact efficiently with this moiety under physiological conditions. To evaluate the ability of IFIT1 to have an impact on negative-sense RNA viruses, we infected Ifit1(-/-) and wild-type control mice and primary cells with four negative-sense RNA viruses (influenza A virus [IAV], La Crosse virus [LACV], Oropouche virus [OROV], and Ebola virus) corresponding to three distinct families. Unexpectedly, a lack of Ifit1 gene expression did not result in increased infection by any of these viruses in cell culture. Analogously, morbidity, mortality, and viral burdens in tissues were identical between Ifit1(-/-) and control mice after infection with IAV, LACV, or OROV. Finally, deletion of the human IFIT1 protein in A549 cells did not affect IAV replication or infection, and reciprocally, ectopic expression of IFIT1 in HEK293T cells did not inhibit IAV infection. To explain the lack of antiviral activity against IAV, we measured the binding affinity of IFIT1 for RNA oligonucleotides resembling the 5' ends of IAV gene segments. The affinity for 5'-ppp RNA was approximately 10-fold lower than that for non-2'-O-methylated (cap 0) RNA oligonucleotides. Based on this analysis, we conclude that IFIT1 is not a dominant restriction factor against negative-sense RNA viruses., IMPORTANCE: Negative-sense RNA viruses, including influenza virus and Ebola virus, have been responsible for some of the most deadly outbreaks in recent history. The host interferon response and induction of antiviral genes contribute to the control of infections by these viruses. IFIT1 is highly induced after virus infection and reportedly has antiviral activity against several RNA and DNA viruses. However, its role in restricting infection by negative-sense RNA viruses remains unclear. In this study, we evaluated the ability of IFIT1 to inhibit negative-sense RNA virus replication and pathogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Detailed cell culture and animal studies demonstrated that IFIT1 is not a dominant restriction factor against three different families of negative-sense RNA viruses.

Herein, an in-house droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay was used for the detection and quantification of OROV., METHODS: The ddPCR reaction was assessed as duplex assay using the human housekeeping gene RPP30. Limit of detection (LoD) analysis was performed in whole blood, serum, and urine. The assay was executed on a total of 28 clinical samples (whole blood n = 9, serum n = 11, and urine n = 8), of which 16 specimens were tested positive at the routine molecular diagnostics (endpoint and real-time PCRs)., RESULTS: The LoD of the ddPCR performed using 10-fold serial dilution of OROV detected up to 1 cp/microL in all the biological matrices. Compared to the routine molecular diagnostics, the ddPCR assay showed 100% sensitivity for whole blood and serum and 75% for urine, highlighting higher positive rate of ddPCR., CONCLUSION: We have established a quantitative RNA detection method of OROV with high sensitivity and specificity based on ddPCR. This test is capable of quantitatively monitoring the viral load of OROV and can contribute, in addition to laboratory diagnosis, to shed light on the pathogenesis, filling in the knowledge gaps of this neglected disease and to the vector control programs.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pomari Elena; Matucci Andrea; Accordini Silvia; Mantovani Rebeca Passarelli; Gianesini Natasha; Mori Antonio; Castilletti Concetta; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Humans\r\nBunyaviridae Infections/di [Diagnosis]\r\nBunyaviridae Infections/vi [Virology]\r\n*Bunyaviridae Infections\r\nOrthobunyavirus/ge [Genetics]\r\nOrthobunyavirus/ip [Isolation & Purification]\r\nOrthobunyavirus/cl [Classification]\r\n*Orthobunyavirus\r\n*Sensitivity and Specificity\r\nRNA, Viral/ge [Genetics]\r\nRNA, Viral/ur [Urine]\r\n*RNA, Viral\r\nViral Load/mt [Methods]\r\n*Viral Load\r\nLimit of Detection\r\nReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/mt [Methods]\r\nPolymerase Chain Reaction/mt [Methods]","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pomari Elena, Matucci Andrea, Accordini Silvia, Mantovani Rebeca Passarelli, Gianesini Natasha, Mori Antonio, and Castilletti Concetta (2024) ddPCR for the Detection and Absolute Quantification of Oropouche Virus.

Using ecological niche modeling (ENM) with random forests, we assessed the environmental suitability of OROV and its primary vector, Culicoides paraensis, across Brazil and the Americas. We evaluated five pseudo-absence sampling techniques, considering pseudo-absence ratios, buffer radii, and density smoothing factors to determine the most effective modeling approach. Key environmental predictors included humidity, agricultural land-use, and forest cover, while temperature had minimal influence for both the virus and the vector. The resulting suitability model identifies high transmission risk areas in Central and South America, and reveals that environmental suitability patterns align with seasonal fluctuations in case numbers, with peaks in Amazonian states at the beginning of the year and an expansion into non-Amazonian regions later in the year. A bivariate suitability map highlighted strong spatial overlap between OROV and Culicoides paraensis, with potential co-suitability areas with Culex quinquefasciatus mosquito, a suspected secondary vector. These findings enhance understanding of OROV transmission dynamics, supporting risk assessment, surveillance, and vector control strategies.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Poongavanan Jenicca; Dunaiski Marcel; D'or Graeme; Kraemer Moritz U.

Despite its clinical relevance, little is known about OROV pathogenesis. To define the host defense pathways that control OROV infection and disease, we evaluated OROV pathogenesis and immune responses in primary cells and mice that were deficient in the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway (MDA5, RIG-I, or MAVS), downstream regulatory transcription factors (IRF-3 or IRF-7), beta interferon (IFN-beta), or the receptor for type I IFN signaling (IFNAR). OROV replicated to higher levels in primary fibroblasts and dendritic cells lacking MAVS signaling, the transcription factors IRF-3 and IRF-7, or IFNAR than in wild-type (WT) cells. In mice, deletion of IFNAR, MAVS, or IRF-3 and IRF-7 resulted in uncontrolled OROV replication, hypercytokinemia, extensive liver damage, and death, whereas WT congenic animals failed to develop disease. Unexpectedly, mice with a selective deletion of IFNAR on myeloid cells (CD11c Cre(+) Ifnar(f/f) or LysM Cre(+) Ifnar(f/f)) did not sustain enhanced disease with OROV or a selective (flox/flox) deletion La Crosse virus, a closely related encephalitic orthobunyavirus. In bone marrow chimera studies, recipient irradiated Ifnar(-/-) mice reconstituted with WT hematopoietic cells sustained high levels of OROV replication and liver damage, whereas WT mice reconstituted with Ifnar(-/-) bone marrow were resistant to disease. Collectively, these results establish a dominant protective role for MAVS, IRF-3 and IRF-7, and IFNAR in restricting OROV infection and tissue injury and suggest that IFN signaling in nonmyeloid cells contributes to the host defense against orthobunyaviruses., IMPORTANCE: Oropouche virus (OROV) is an emerging arthropod-transmitted orthobunyavirus that causes episodic outbreaks of a debilitating febrile illness in humans in countries of South and Central America. The continued expansion of the range and number of its arthropod vectors increases the likelihood that OROV will spread into new regions. At present, the pathogenesis of OROV in humans or other vertebrate animals remains poorly understood. To define cellular mechanisms of control of OROV infection, we performed infection studies in a series of primary cells and mice that were deficient in key innate immune genes involved in pathogen recognition and control. Our results establish that a MAVS-dependent type I IFN signaling pathway has a dominant role in restricting OROV infection and pathogenesis in vivo.

To define the role of IRF-5 during bunyavirus infection, we evaluated Oropouche virus (OROV) and La Crosse virus (LACV) pathogenesis and immune responses in primary cells and in mice with gene deletions in Irf3, Irf5, and Irf7 or in Irf5 alone. Deletion of Irf3, Irf5, and Irf7 together resulted in uncontrolled viral replication in the liver and spleen, hypercytokinemia, extensive liver injury, and an early-death phenotype. Remarkably, deletion of Irf5 alone resulted in meningoencephalitis and death on a more protracted timeline, 1 to 2 weeks after initial OROV or LACV infection. The clinical signs in OROV-infected Irf5(-/-) mice were associated with abundant viral antigen and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells in several regions of the brain. Circulating dendritic cell (DC) subsets in Irf5(-/-) mice had higher levels of OROV RNA in vivo yet produced lower levels of type I IFN than wild-type (WT) cells. This result was supported by data obtained in vitro, since a deficiency of IRF-5 resulted in enhanced OROV infection and diminished type I IFN production in bone marrow-derived DCs. Collectively, these results indicate a key role for IRF-5 in modulating the host antiviral response in peripheral organs that controls bunyavirus neuroinvasion in mice., IMPORTANCE: Oropouche virus (OROV) and La Crosse virus (LACV) are orthobunyaviruses that are transmitted by insects and cause meningitis and encephalitis in subsets of individuals in the Americas. Recently, we demonstrated that components of the type I interferon (IFN) induction pathway, particularly the regulatory transcription factors IRF-3 and IRF-7, have key protective roles during OROV infection. However, the lethality in Irf3(-/-) Irf7(-/-) (DKO) mice infected with OROV was not as rapid or complete as observed in Ifnar(-/-) mice, indicating that other transcriptional factors associated with an IFN response contribute to antiviral immunity against OROV. Here, we evaluated bunyavirus replication, tissue tropism, and cytokine production in primary cells and mice lacking IRF-5. We demonstrate an important role for IRF-5 in preventing neuroinvasion and the ensuing encephalitis caused by OROV and LACV. Copyright &#xa9; 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

Positive samples were amplified by conventional PCR and sequenced utilizing the Sanger method. The obtained sequences were aligned, and an evolutionary analysis was carried out using Bayesian inference. A total of 308 samples were tested. Of this total, 20 had a detectable viral load for Dengue, being detected DENV1 (18/20), co-infection DENV1 and DENV2 (1/20) and DENV4 (1/20). For Dengue serotype 3 and for the CHIKV, ZIKV, MAYV and OROV viruses, no individuals with a detectable viral load were found. A total of 9 of these samples were magnified by conventional PCR for sequencing. Of these, 6 were successfully sequenced and, according to the evolutionary profile, 5 corresponded to serotype DENV-1 genotype V, and 1 to serotype DENV-4 genotype II. In the study, we demonstrate co-circulation of the DENV-1 genotype V and the DENV-4 genotype II. Co-circulation of several DENV serotypes in the same city poses a risk to the population and is correlated with the increase of the most severe forms of the disease. Similarly, co-circulation of genetically distinct DENV and the occurrence of simultaneous infections can affect recombination events and lead to the emergence of more virulent isolates.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Queiroz Jackson Alves da Silva; Botelho-Souza Luan Felipo; Nogueira-Lima Felipe Souza; Rampazzo Rita de Cassia Pontello; Krieger Marco Aurelio; Zambenedetti Miriam Ribas; Marchini Fabricio Klerinton; Borghetti Ivo Alberto; Pereira Dhelio Batista; Salcedo Juan Miguel Vilalobos; Vieira Deusilene Souza; Santos Alcione de Oliveira Dos; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Acute Disease/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nArbovirus Infections/ep [Epidemiology]\r\n*Arbovirus Infections/vi [Virology]\r\n*Arboviruses/cl [Classification]\r\nArboviruses/py [Pathogenicity]\r\nBrazil/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nCoinfection/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nCoinfection/vi [Virology]\r\nDengue/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nDengue Virus/ge [Genetics]\r\nDisease Outbreaks\r\nEvolution, Molecular\r\nFemale\r\nFever/ep [Epidemiology]\r\n*Fever/vi [Virology]\r\nGenotype\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\n*Phylogeny\r\nRNA, Viral/ge [Genetics]\r\nSerogroup\r\nViral Load","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Queiroz Jackson Alves da Silva, Botelho-Souza Luan Felipo, Nogueira-Lima Felipe Souza, Rampazzo Rita de Cassia Pontello, Krieger Marco Aurelio, Zambenedetti Miriam Ribas, Marchini Fabricio Klerinton, Borghetti Ivo Alberto, Pereira Dhelio Batista, Salcedo Juan Miguel Vilalobos, Vieira Deusilene Souza, and Santos Alcione de Oliveira Dos (2020) Phylogenetic Characterization of Arboviruses in Patients Suffering from Acute Fever in Rondonia, Brazil.

Malaria, arboviral diseases, and leptospirosis are the most important etiologies. These are highly endemic in the Uraba antioqueno, Colombia, being the main causes of fever in several municipalities in this region. However, up-to-date data regarding the infecting species and serotypes are lacking. Thus, we characterized the etiology of AUFI, focusing on malaria, arboviruses, and leptospirosis in this region and the circulating infecting species. An active surveillance was conducted between January and April 2022, and July and October 2023 in two local hospitals in the Uraba antioqueno. Febrile patients were enrolled voluntarily. Malaria, arboviral diseases, and leptospirosis were screened through direct, serological, molecular, and rapid diagnostic methods. Amplicons obtained for dengue virus (DENV) and Leptospira spp. were analyzed through phylogenetic analysis. A total of 184 febrile patients were enrolled. A confirmed etiology was detected in 43.4% of patients from Apartado and 61.2% from Turbo. Malaria was the most frequent cause in both municipalities, which was caused mainly by Plasmodium falciparum in Apartado and Plasmodium vivax in Turbo. Dengue virus serotype 1 genotype V, DENV genotype Asian-American, and DENV genotype Cosmopolitan were identified, as well as pathogenic Leptospira species closely related to Leptospira santarosai and Leptospira noguchii. The present study confirms the importance of malaria, dengue fever, and leptospirosis in the Uraba antioqueno. Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax were identified, as well as two DENV serotypes and three DENV genotypes and two different Leptospira species.Copyright © 2025 American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Restrepo-Lopez N; Silva-Ramos C R; Rodas J D; Arboleda M; Fernandez D; Uribe-Restrepo P; Agudelo-Florez P; Tobon-Castano A; Hidalgo M; Melby P C; Aguilar P V; Cabada M M; Diaz F J; Mozo K; Gonzalez-Diaz E S; Jimenez-Coello M; Dacso M M; Ortega-Pacheco A; Walker D H; Weaver S C; Paulino-Ramirez R; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"active surveillance\r\n*acute febrile illness\r\nadolescent\r\nadult\r\nArbovirus\r\narticle\r\nChikungunya virus\r\n*dengue\r\nDengue virus\r\nenzyme linked immunosorbent assay\r\nfemale\r\nhuman\r\nLeptospira\r\nLeptospira interrogans serovar Autumnalis\r\nLeptospira interrogans serovar Copenhageni\r\nLeptospira interrogans serovar Hebdomadis\r\nLeptospira interrogans serovar Icterohaemorrhagiae\r\n*leptospirosis\r\n*malaria\r\nmale\r\nMayaro virus\r\nnested polymerase chain reaction\r\nOropouche virus\r\nphylogeny\r\nPlasmodium falciparum\r\nPlasmodium vivax\r\nreal time polymerase chain reaction\r\nreverse transcription polymerase chain reaction\r\nserotype\r\nVenezuelan equine encephalitis virus\r\nYellow fever virus\r\nyoung adult\r\nnonstructural protein 1/ec [Endogenous Compound]\r\nbioinformatics software\r\nDengue virus test kit\r\nELISA kit\r\ngenetic analyzer\r\nLasergene\r\nMalaria Antigen Pf/PvVR rapid diagnostic test\r\nMEGA software v.11.0.13\r\nMrBayes v.3.2.7\r\nSD Bioline Dengue Duo\r\nSeqMan NGen sequence assembly and analysis software\r\nSeqMan Pro","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Restrepo-Lopez N, Silva-Ramos C R, Rodas J D, Arboleda M, Fernandez D, Uribe-Restrepo P, Agudelo-Florez P, Tobon-Castano A, Hidalgo M, Melby P C, Aguilar P V, Cabada M M, Diaz F J, Mozo K, Gonzalez-Diaz E S, Jimenez-Coello M, Dacso M M, Ortega-Pacheco A, Walker D H, Weaver S C, and Paulino-Ramirez R (2025) Malaria, Dengue Fever, and Leptospirosis in the Uraba Antioqueno Region, Colombia: Etiological and Molecular Characterization among Patients with Acute Undifferentiated Febrile Illness.

Little is known about the role of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) response during OROV infection in humans. Thus, to evaluate human leukocytes susceptibility, permissiveness and immune response during OROV infection, we applied RNA hybridization, qRT-PCR and cell-based assays to quantify viral antigens, genome, antigenome and gene expression in different cells. First, we observed OROV replication in human leukocytes lineages as THP-1 monocytes, Jeko-1 B cells and Jurkat T cells. Interestingly, cell viability and viral particle detection are maintained in these cells, even after successive passages. PBMCs from healthy donors were susceptible but the infection was not productive, since neither antigenome nor infectious particle was found in the supernatant of infected PBMCs. In fact, only viral antigens and small quantities of OROV genome were detected at 24 hpi in lymphocytes, monocytes and CD11c<ovid:sup>+</ovid:sup> cells. Finally, activation of the Interferon (IFN) response was essential to restrict OROV replication in human PBMCs. Increased expression of type I/III IFNs, ISGs and inflammatory cytokines was detected in the first 24 hpi and viral replication was re-established after blocking IFNAR or treating cells with glucocorticoid. Thus, in short, our results show OROV is able to infect and remain in low titers in human T cells, monocytes, DCs and B cells as a consequence of an effective IFN response after infection, indicating the possibility of leukocytes serving as a trojan horse in specific microenvironments during immunosuppression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ribeiro Amorim; Mariene; Cornejo Pontelli; Marjorie; Fabiano de Souza, Gabriela; Primon Muraro; Stefanie; de Toledo-Teixeira Daniel Augusto; Forato Julia; Bispo-Dos-Santos Karina; Barbosa Natalia S; Cavalheiro Martini; Matheus; Lorencini Parise; Pierina; Vieira Aline; Paier Milanez; Guilherme; Lamberti Pinto daSilva; Luis; Jaychand Lalwani; Pritesh; Santos Farias; Alessandro; Ramirez Vinolo; Marco Aurelio; Sesti-Costa Renata; Arruda Eurico; Proenca-Modena Jose Luiz; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"*Bunyaviridae Infections/me [Metabolism]\r\nFlow Cytometry\r\nFluorescent Antibody Technique\r\nGenome, Viral/ge [Genetics]\r\nHumans\r\n*Leukocytes, Mononuclear/vi [Virology]\r\nMicroscopy, Confocal\r\nOrthobunyavirus/ge [Genetics]\r\nOrthobunyavirus/me [Metabolism]\r\nOrthobunyavirus/ph [Physiology]\r\n*Orthobunyavirus\r\n*RNA, Viral/me [Metabolism]\r\nReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction\r\nVirus Replication","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ribeiro Amorim, Mariene, Cornejo Pontelli, Marjorie, Fabiano de Souza, Gabriela, Primon Muraro, Stefanie, de Toledo-Teixeira Daniel Augusto, Forato Julia, Bispo-Dos-Santos Karina, Barbosa Natalia S, Cavalheiro Martini, Matheus, Lorencini Parise, Pierina, Vieira Aline, Paier Milanez, Guilherme, Lamberti Pinto daSilva, Luis, Jaychand Lalwani, Pritesh, Santos Farias, Alessandro, Ramirez Vinolo, Marco Aurelio, Sesti-Costa Renata, Arruda Eurico, and Proenca-Modena Jose Luiz (2020) Oropouche Virus Infects, Persists and Induces IFN Response in Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells as Identified by RNA PrimeFlow TM and qRT-PCR Assays.

This year, an OROV outbreak was identified in Brazil, and its vertical transmission was reported, which was associated with fetal death and microcephaly. We describe the clinical manifestations identified in three cases of congenital OROV infection with confirmed serology (OROV-IgM) in the mother-newborn binomial. One of the newborns died, and post-mortem molecular analysis using real-time RT-qPCR identified the OROV genome in several tissues. All three newborns were born in the Amazon region in Brazil, and the mothers reported fever, rash, headache, myalgia, and/or retro-orbital pain during pregnancy. The newborns presented with severe microcephaly secondary to brain damage and arthrogryposis, suggestive of an embryo/fetal disruptive process at birth. Brain and spinal images identified overlapping sutures, cerebral atrophy, brain cysts, thinning of the spinal cord, corpus callosum, and posterior fossa abnormalities. Fundoscopic findings included macular chorioretinal scars, focal pigment mottling, and vascular attenuation. The clinical presentation of vertical OROV infection resembled congenital Zika syndrome to some extent but presents some distinctive features on brain imaging and in several aspects of its neurological presentation. A recognizable syndrome with severe brain damage, neurological alterations, arthrogryposis, and fundoscopic abnormalities can be associated with in utero OROV infection.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ribeiro Bethania de Freitas Rodrigues; Barreto Andre Rodrigues Facanha; Pessoa Andre; Azevedo Raimunda do Socorro da Silva; Rodrigues Flavia de Freitas; Borges Bruna da Cruz Beyruth; Mantilla Natalia Pimentel Moreno; Muniz Davi Dantas; Chiang Jannifer Oliveira; Fraga Lucas Rosa; Vianna Fernanda Sales Luiz; Sanseverino Maria Teresa Vieira; Faccini Lilith Schuler; Martins Fernanda Eduarda das Neves; Azevedo Rafael da Silva; Martins Livia Caricio; Casseb Livia Medeiros Neves; Oliveira Consuelo Silva; Vasconcelos Pedro Fernando da Costa; Quaresma Juarez Antonio Simoes; Abeche Alberto Mantovani; Prazeres Vania de Mesquita Gadelha; Oliveira Lucia Andreia Nunes de; Karam Simone de Menezes; Radin Giulia; Del Campo Miguel; Ventura Camila V; Schuler-Faccini Lavinia; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Humans\r\nFemale\r\nInfant, Newborn\r\nBrazil/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nPregnancy\r\n*Bunyaviridae Infections/cn [Congenital]\r\n*Bunyaviridae Infections/vi [Virology]\r\n*Bunyaviridae Infections/co [Complications]\r\n*Bunyaviridae Infections/ep [Epidemiology]\r\n*Bunyaviridae Infections/pa [Pathology]\r\nMicrocephaly/vi [Virology]\r\n*Orthobunyavirus/ge [Genetics]\r\n*Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/vi [Virology]\r\nMale\r\nInfectious Disease Transmission, Vertical\r\nAdult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ribeiro Bethania de Freitas Rodrigues, Barreto Andre Rodrigues Facanha, Pessoa Andre, Azevedo Raimunda do Socorro da Silva, Rodrigues Flavia de Freitas, Borges Bruna da Cruz Beyruth, Mantilla Natalia Pimentel Moreno, Muniz Davi Dantas, Chiang Jannifer Oliveira, Fraga Lucas Rosa, Vianna Fernanda Sales Luiz, Sanseverino Maria Teresa Vieira, Faccini Lilith Schuler, Martins Fernanda Eduarda das Neves, Azevedo Rafael da Silva, Martins Livia Caricio, Casseb Livia Medeiros Neves, Oliveira Consuelo Silva, Vasconcelos Pedro Fernando da Costa, Quaresma Juarez Antonio Simoes, Abeche Alberto Mantovani, Prazeres Vania de Mesquita Gadelha, Oliveira Lucia Andreia Nunes de, Karam Simone de Menezes, Radin Giulia, Del Campo Miguel, Ventura Camila V, and Schuler-Faccini Lavinia (2025) Congenital Oropouche in Humans: Clinical Characterization of a Possible New Teratogenic Syndrome.

In spite of this, little is known about pathogenesis of OROV infection. This report describes an experimental model of OROV in golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus). Following subcutaneous inoculation of OROV, over 50% of the animals developed disease characterized by lethargy, ruffled fur, shivering, paralysis, and approximately one third died. Animals were sacrificed on days 1, 3, 5, 8 and 11 post-inoculation to collect tissue samples from brain, heart, liver, lung, spleen, muscle and blood for virus titration, histology and OROV immunohistochemistry. OROV was detected in high titers in blood, liver and brain, but not in the other organs. Histopathology revealed meningoencephalitis and hepatitis, with abundant OROV antigen detected in liver and brain. Diffuse galectin-3 immunostaining in brain and liver supports microglial and Kupfer cells activation. This is the first description of an experimental model for OROV infection and should be helpful to study pathogenesis and possibly to test antiviral interventions such as drugs and vaccine candidates.

Clinical presentation of Oropouche fever in humans includes fever, headache, rash, myalgia, and in rare cases spontaneous bleeding and aseptic meningitis. Landscape change has been proposed as a driver of Oropouche fever emergence., OBJECTIVE: To investigate the landscape epidemiology of the Oropouche fever outbreak that began in April 2016 in Cusco, Peru., METHODS: We used information of vegetation and multivariate spatial analyses including ecological niche modeling. Vegetation was characterised using16-day composite enhanced vegetation index (EVI) images at 500 m spatial resolution from the MODIS sensor carried by the Terra satellite., FINDINGS: Cases were distributed across seven Peruvian districts in two provinces. La Concepcion was the province with most of the affected districts. EVI time series across 2000 to 2016 suggested a decline in the vegetation in sites with Oropouche fever cases before the epidemic. Our ecological niche modeling suggests that other areas in Junin, Apurimac, and Madre de Dios departments are at risk of Oropouche fever occurrence., MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our results may provide a guide for future fieldwork to test hypotheses regarding Oropouche fever emergence and habitat loss in tropical Latin America.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Romero-Alvarez Daniel; Escobar Luis E; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"*Arbovirus Infections/ep [Epidemiology]\r\n*Arbovirus Infections/tm [Transmission]\r\n*Disease Outbreaks\r\n*Ecosystem\r\nGeographic Information Systems\r\nHumans\r\nPeru/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nRisk Factors","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Romero-Alvarez Daniel, and Escobar Luis E (2017) Vegetation loss and the 2016 Oropouche fever outbreak in Peru.

Oropouche fever, caused by Oropouche virus (OROV), is an understudied zoonotic VBD febrile illness reported in Central and South America. The epidemic potential and areas of likely OROV spread remain unexplored, limiting capacities to improve epidemiological surveillance., METHODS: To better understand the capacity for spread of OROV, we developed spatial epidemiology models using human outbreaks as OROV transmission-locality data, coupled with high-resolution satellite-derived vegetation phenology. Data were integrated using hypervolume modeling to infer likely areas of OROV transmission and emergence across the Americas., RESULTS: Models based on one-support vector machine hypervolumes consistently predicted risk areas for OROV transmission across the tropics of Latin America despite the inclusion of different parameters such as different study areas and environmental predictors. Models estimate that up to 5 million people are at risk of exposure to OROV. Nevertheless, the limited epidemiological data available generates uncertainty in projections. For example, some outbreaks have occurred under climatic conditions outside those where most transmission events occur. The distribution models also revealed that landscape variation, expressed as vegetation loss, is linked to OROV outbreaks., CONCLUSIONS: Hotspots of OROV transmission risk were detected along the tropics of South America. Vegetation loss might be a driver of Oropouche fever emergence. Modeling based on hypervolumes in spatial epidemiology might be considered an exploratory tool for analyzing data-limited emerging infectious diseases for which little understanding exists on their sylvatic cycles. OROV transmission risk maps can be used to improve surveillance, investigate OROV ecology and epidemiology, and inform early detection. Copyright &#xa9; 2023.

In the virion-complementary orientation, the RNA contained two overlapping open reading frames of 693 and 273 nucleotides that were predicted to encode proteins of 231 and 91 amino acids, respectively. Subsequently, the nucleotide sequences of the nucleocapsid genes of 27 additional ORO virus strains, representing a 42 year interval and a wide geographical range in South America, were determined. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that all the ORO virus strains formed a monophyletic group that comprised three distinct lineages. Lineage I contained the prototype strain from Trinidad and most of the Brazilian strains, lineage II contained six Peruvian strains isolated between 1992 and 1998, and two strains from western Brazil isolated in 1991, while lineage III comprised four strains isolated in Panama during 1989.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Saeed M F; Wang H; Nunes M; Vasconcelos P F; Weaver S C; Shope R E; Watts D M; Tesh R B; Barrett A D; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBase Sequence\r\nDNA Primers/ge [Genetics]\r\n*Genes, Viral\r\nHumans\r\nMolecular Sequence Data\r\n*Nucleocapsid/ge [Genetics]\r\nOpen Reading Frames\r\nOrthobunyavirus/cl [Classification]\r\nOrthobunyavirus/ge [Genetics]\r\nPhylogeny\r\nRNA, Viral/ge [Genetics]\r\nSimbu virus/cl [Classification]\r\n*Simbu virus/ge [Genetics]\r\nSimbu virus/ip [Isolation & Purification]\r\nSouth America","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Saeed M F, Wang H, Nunes M, Vasconcelos P F, Weaver S C, Shope R E, Watts D M, Tesh R B, and Barrett A D (2000) Nucleotide sequences and phylogeny of the nucleocapsid gene of Oropouche virus.

Diagnosis of ORO virus infection is based mainly on serology. Two different antigens, hamster serum antigen (HSA) and Vero cell lysate antigen (VCLA), are currently used in enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) in Brazil and Peru, respectively, to investigate the epidemiology of ORO virus infection. Both antigens involve use of infectious virus, and for this reason their use is restricted. Consequently, the frequency and distribution of ORO virus infection are largely unexplored in other countries of South America. This report describes the use of a bacterially expressed recombinant nucleocapsid (rN) protein of ORO virus in EIAs for the diagnosis of ORO virus infection. The data revealed that the purified rN protein is comparable to the authentic viral N protein in its antigenic characteristics and is highly sensitive and specific in EIAs. Among 183 serum samples tested, a high degree of concordance was found between rN protein-based EIA and HSA- and VCLA-based EIAs for the detection of both ORO virus-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies. The high sensitivity, specificity, and safety of the rN protein-based EIA make it a useful diagnostic technique that can be widely used to detect ORO virus infection in South America.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Saeed M F; Nunes M; Vasconcelos P F; Travassos Da Rosa, A.

On the basis of nucleotide sequencing, we have found that the small (S) RNA of JAT virus is very similar (>95% identity) to that of Oropouche (ORO) virus, in particular, the Peruvian genotype of ORO virus. In comparison, limited nucleotide sequencing of the G2 protein gene, encoded by the middle (M) RNA, of JAT and ORO viruses, revealed relatively little identity (<66%) between these two viruses. Neutralization tests confirmed the lack of cross-reactivity between the viruses. These results suggest that JAT virus is a reassortant containing the S RNA of ORO virus.

It has a high epidemic potential, causing illness in over 500,000 cases diagnosed since the virus was first discovered in 1955. Currently, the prevention of human viral infection depends on vaccination, but availability for many viruses is limited, and they are classified as neglected viruses. At present, there are no vaccines or antiviral treatments available. An alternative approach to limiting the spread of the virus is to selectively disrupt viral replication mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate the inhibitory effect of acridones, which efficiently inhibited viral replication by 99.9 % in vitro. To evaluate possible mechanisms of action, we conducted tests with dsRNA, an intermediate in virus replication, as well as MD simulations, docking, and binding free energy analysis. The results showed a strong interaction between FAC21 and the OROV endonuclease, which possibly limits the interaction of viral RNA with other proteins. Therefore, our results suggest a dual mechanism of antiviral action, possibly caused by ds-RNA intercalation. In summary, our findings demonstrate that a new generation of antiviral drugs could be developed based on the selective optimization of molecules.

The introduction of Zika and Chikungunya diseases in the Americas has exposed unforeseen medical and logistical challenges for public health systems. Moreover, the lack of preventive measures and vaccination against known and emerging mosquito-transmitted pathogens, and the occurrence of unanticipated clinical complications, has had an enormous social and economic impact on the affected populations. In this study, we aimed to measure the seroprevalence of endemic and emerging viral pathogens in military personnel stationed in Manaus, Amazonas state., METHODS: We measured the seropositivity of antibodies against 19 endemic and emerging viruses in a healthy military personnel group using a hemagglutination inhibition assay (HIA)., RESULTS: Overall, DENV positivity was 60.4%, and 30.9% of the individuals reacted against ZIKV. Also, 46.6%, 54.7%, 51.3% and 48.7% individuals reacted against West Nile virus (WNV), Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), Ilheus virus (ILHV) and Rocio virus (ROCV), respectively. Individuals with high DENV HIA titer reacted more frequently with ZIKV or WNV compared to those with low HIA titers. Observed cross-reactivity between Flaviviruses varied depending on the virus serogroup. Additionally, 0.6% and 0.3% individuals were seropositive for Oropouche virus (OROV) and Catu virus (CATUV) from the family Peribunyaviridae, respectively. All samples were negative for Eastern Equine Encephalitis virus (EEEV), Western Equine Encephalomyelitis virus (WEEV), Mayaro virus (MAYV), Mucambo virus (MUCV) and CHIKV from the family Togaviridae., CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of individuals in our high-risk population (~ 60%) lacked antibodies against major endemic and emerging viruses, which makes them susceptible for further infections. Military personnel serving in the Amazon region could serve as sentinels to strengthen global infectious disease surveillance, particularly in remote areas. Copyright &#xa9; 2021.

Dengue, Chikungunya, Zika, Mayaro, and Usutu, among others, can coexist in the American tropics. This study aimed to surveil the arboviruses that cause, acute febrile syndrome in patients in the Meta department, Colombia., METHODS: Between June 2021 and February 2023, an epidemiological surveillance study was conducted in the Llanos of the Meta department in Eastern Colombia., RESULTS: One hundred patients in the acute phase with typical prodromal symptoms of NEATFI infection who attended the emergency department of the Villavicencio Departmental Hospital were included. ELISA tests were performed for Dengue, Usutu, Chikungunya, and Mayaro. RT-qPCR was performed to detect the arboviruses Usutu, Dengue, Zika, Mayaro, and Oropouche. The seroprevalence for the Chikungunya, Mayaro, and Usutu viruses was 41 % (28/68), 40 % (27/67), and 62 % (47/75), respectively. Seroconversion for Chikungunya was observed in one patient; two seroconverted to Mayaro and one to Usutu. The NS5 gene fragment of the Usutu virus was detected in nine febrile patients. RT-qPCR of the remaining arboviruses was negative. The clinical symptoms of the nine Usutu-positive patients were very similar to those of Dengue, Chikungunya, Zika, and Mayaro infections., CONCLUSIONS: The pervasive detection of unexpected viruses such as Usutu and Mayaro demonstrated the importance of searching for other viruses different from Dengue. Because Usutu infection and Mayaro fever have clinical features like Dengue, a new algorithm should be proposed to improve the accuracy of acute tropical fevers. Copyright &#xa9; 2024 The Authors.

An estimated 500,000 cases of Oropouche fever have occurred in Brazil in the last 30 years, with recorded cases also in Panama, Peru, Suriname and Trinidad. We have developed an experimental model of Oropouche virus infection in neonatal BALB/c mouse by subcutaneous inoculation. The vast majority of infected animals developed disease on the 5th day post infection, characterized mainly by lethargy and paralysis, progressing to death within 10 days. Viral replication was documented in brain cells by in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry and virus titration. Multi-step immunohistochemistry indicated neurons as the main target cells of OROV infection. Histopathology revealed glial reaction and astrocyte activation in the brain and spinal cord, with neuronal apoptosis. Spleen hyperplasia and mild meningitis were also found, without viable virus detected in liver and spleen. This is the first report of an experimental mouse model of OROV infection, with severe involvement of the central nervous system, and should become useful in pathogenesis studies, as well as in preclinical testing of therapeutic interventions for this emerging pathogen.

In the present study, neonatal BALB/c mice were inoculated with OROV by the subcutaneous route and the progression of OROV spread into the CNS was evaluated. Immunohistochemistry revealed that OROV infection advances from posterior parts of the brain, including the periaqueductal gray, toward the forebrain. In the early phases of the infection OROV gains access to neural routes, reaching the spinal cord and ascending to the brain through brainstem regions, with little inflammation. Later, as infection progresses, OROV crosses the blood-brain barrier, resulting in more intense spread into the brain parenchyma, with more severe manifestations of encephalitis.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Santos Rodrigo I; Bueno-Junior Lezio S; Ruggiero Rafael N; Almeida Mariana F; Silva Maria L; Paula Flavia E; Correa Vani M.

This study investigates virological factors contributing to the re-emergence of Oropouche fever in Brazil between 2023 and 2024., METHODS: In this observational epidemiological study, we combined multiple data sources for Oropouche virus infections in Brazil and conducted in-vitro and in-vivo characterisation. We collected serum samples obtained in Manaus City, Amazonas state, Brazil, from patients with acute febrile illnesses aged 18 years or older who tested negative for malaria and samples from people with previous Oropouche virus infection from Coari municipality, Amazonas state, Brazil. Basic clinical and demographic data were collected from the Brazilian Laboratory Environment Management System. We calculated the incidence of Oropouche fever cases with data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health and the 2022 Brazilian population census and conducted age-sex analyses. We used reverse transcription quantitative PCR to test for Oropouche virus RNA in samples and subsequently performed sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of viral isolates. We compared the phenotype of the 2023-24 epidemic isolate (AM0088) with the historical prototype strain BeAn19991 through assessment of titre, plaque number, and plaque size. We used a plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT<ovid:sub>50</ovid:sub>) to assess the susceptibility of the novel isolate and BeAn19991 isolate to antibody neutralisation, both in serum samples from people previously infected with Oropouche virus and in blood collected from mice that were inoculated with either of the strains., FINDINGS: 8639 (81.8%) of 10 557 laboratory-confirmed Oropouche fever cases from Jan 4, 2015, to Aug 10, 2024, occurred in 2024, which is 58.8 times the annual median of 147 cases (IQR 73-325). Oropouche virus infections were reported in all 27 federal units, with 8182 (77.5%) of 10 557 infections occurring in North Brazil. We detected Oropouche virus RNA in ten (11%) of 93 patients with acute febrile illness between Jan 1 and Feb 4, 2024, in Amazonas state. AM0088 had a significantly higher replication at 12 h and 24 h after infection in mammalian cells than the prototype strain. AM0088 had a more virulent phenotype than the prototype in mammalian cells, characterised by earlier plaque formation, between 27% and 65% increase in plaque number, and plaques between 2.4-times and 2.6-times larger. Furthermore, serum collected on May 2 and May 20, 2016, from individuals previously infected with Oropouche virus showed at least a 32-fold reduction in neutralising capacity (ie, median PRNT<ovid:sub>50</ovid:sub> titre of 640 [IQR 320-640] for BeAn19991 vs <20 [ie, below the limit of detection] for AM0088) against the reassortant strain compared with the prototype., INTERPRETATION: These findings provide a comprehensive assessment of Oropouche fever in Brazil and contribute to an improved understanding of the 2023-24 Oropouche virus re-emergence. Our exploratory in-vitro data suggest that the increased incidence might be related to a higher replication efficiency of a new Oropouche virus reassortant for which previous immunity shows lower neutralising capacity., FUNDING: Sao Paulo Research Foundation, Burroughs Wellcome Fund, Wellcome Trust, US National Institutes of Health, and Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development., TRANSLATION: For the Portuguese translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.

Host factors mediating the cellular entry of OROV are undefined. Here, we show that OROV uses the host protein low-density lipoprotein-related protein 1 (Lrp1) for efficient cellular infection. Cells from evolutionarily distinct species lacking Lrp1 were less permissive to OROV infection than cells with Lrp1. Treatment of cells with either the high-affinity Lrp1 ligand receptor-associated protein (RAP) or recombinant ectodomain truncations of Lrp1 significantly reduced OROV infection. In addition, chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing OROV glycoproteins (VSV-OROV) bound to the Lrp1 ectodomain in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate the biological relevance of the OROV-Lrp1 interaction in a proof-of-concept mouse study in which treatment of mice with RAP at the time of infection reduced tissue viral load and promoted survival from an otherwise lethal infection. These results with OROV, along with the recent finding of Lrp1 as an entry factor for Rift Valley fever virus, highlight the broader significance of Lrp1 in cellular infection by diverse bunyaviruses. Shared strategies for entry, such as the critical function of Lrp1 defined here, provide a foundation for the development of pan-bunyaviral therapeutics.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Schwarz Madeline M; Price David A; Ganaie Safder S; Feng Annie; Mishra Nawneet; Hoehl Ryan M; Fatma Farheen; Stubbs Sarah H; Whelan Sean P.

Residents usually travel by river to rural and urban areas and are then exposed to urbanized diseases such as those caused by arbovirus infection. In Brazil, emerging diseases such as dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and those caused by infection with Oropouche and Mayaro viruses necessitate epidemiological surveillance. This study was aimed at determining the frequency of positivity for immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM antibodies against Zika, chikungunya, and dengue viruses and performing molecular analyses to detect viral RNA for the Zika, chikungunya, dengue virus, Oropouche, and Mayaro viruses, in the same serum samples obtained from riverside populations., METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in a riverside population in the Humaita municipality of the Brazilian Amazon. More than 80% of the local population participated in this study. Entomological samples were collected to identify local mosquito vectors., RESULTS: Analysis of 205 human serological samples revealed IgG antibodies against the dengue virus in 85 individuals. No molecular positivity was observed in human samples. Entomological analyses revealed 3,187 Diptera species, with Mansonia being the most frequent genus. Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus were not detected in the two collections., CONCLUSIONS: IgG antibodies against the dengue virus were highly prevalent, suggesting previous exposure. The absence of the arbovirus vectors Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus in the samples supports the hypothesis that the infections recorded likely occurred outside the riverside communities investigated.","Comments":"BE removed link to pdf https://dx.doi.org/10.1590/0037-8682-0515-2023 ","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Silva Jaqueline Carvalho de Oliveira; Siqueira Igor Rodrigo Ferreira; Dornelas Leormando Fortunato; Ribeiro Cristhian Magalhaes; Gomes Joao Pedro Berno; Guadagnin Iagor Wingenbah; Pereira Antonieta Relvas; Juliao Genimar Reboucas; Camargo Juliana de Souza Almeida Aranha; Basano Sergio Almeida; Camargo Luis Marcelo Aranha; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Animals\r\nHumans\r\nChikungunya Fever/ep [Epidemiology]\r\n*Chikungunya Fever\r\nBrazil/ep [Epidemiology]\r\n*Dengue\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nArbovirus Infections/ep [Epidemiology]\r\n*Arbovirus Infections\r\n*Aedes\r\n*Zika Virus Infection\r\n*Zika Virus\r\n*Alphavirus\r\nMosquito Vectors\r\nImmunoglobulin G","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Silva Jaqueline Carvalho de Oliveira, Siqueira Igor Rodrigo Ferreira, Dornelas Leormando Fortunato, Ribeiro Cristhian Magalhaes, Gomes Joao Pedro Berno, Guadagnin Iagor Wingenbah, Pereira Antonieta Relvas, Juliao Genimar Reboucas, Camargo Juliana de Souza Almeida Aranha, Basano Sergio Almeida, and Camargo Luis Marcelo Aranha (2024) Occurrence of arbovirus infections in two riverine populations in the municipality of Humaita, Amazonas, Brazil.

Symptoms of OROV closely resemble those of Dengue virus and Zika virus, contributing to underreporting and underestimation of its true impact. In the absence of specific treatments, the development of vaccines becomes essential. This study aimed to identify immunogenic epitopes in three structural proteins of OROV and develop a multi-epitope vaccine candidate. RefSeq sequences of the nucleocapsid protein and the Gn and Gc glycoproteins were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Virus and submitted to epitope search in Immune Epitope Database. Antigenicity, allergenicity, stability, and toxicity analyses were conducted, and the approved epitopes were aligned to the global protein to remove transmembrane regions and N-glycosylation sites. Thirteen epitopes were selected and used to construct a multi-epitope vaccine candidate, with beta-defensin and PADRE adjuvants. The protein demonstrated optimal antigenicity, low allergenicity, and satisfactory stability and solubility. Predictions of humoral and cellular immune responses were performed, indicating satisfactory results for three doses of the vaccine candidate. 3D modeling of the protein was performed, evaluating the molecular docking of the multi-epitope protein with TLR-2, TLR-3, TLR-6, and TLR-8 receptors. Our findings present a promising vaccine candidate against OROV, potentially protecting immunocompromised individuals and high-risk populations, and establishing a foundation for both in vitro and in vivo testing. The identified epitopes could also aid in immunodiagnostic test development, advancing surveillance and control strategies. Copyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

Its incidence is under-estimated mainly due to clinical similarities with other endemic arboviral diseases and the lack of specific diagnostic tests. We report the first outbreak of Oropouche fever in a western region of the Peruvian Amazon in Huanuco, Peru., METHODS: A transversal study was carried out during an outbreak in the western Region of Huanuco, Peru between January and July of 2016. Blood samples of 268 patients with acute febrile syndrome were collected and analyzed for OROV via RT- PCR and genetic sequencing., RESULTS: Of all 268 patients, 46 (17%) cases tested positive for OROV. The most common symptoms reported were headache with a frequency of 87% (n = 40) followed by myalgia with 76% (n = 35), arthralgia with 65.2% (n = 30), retro-ocular pain 60.8% (n = 28) and hyporexia with 50% (n = 23). Some patients showed a clinical presentation suggestive of severe OROV infection, of which 4.3% (n = 2) had low platelet count, 8.6% (n = 4) had intense abdominal pain, and 2.1% (n = 1) had a presentation with thoracic pain., CONCLUSION: This study reports an outbreak of OROV in a region where this virus was not previously identified. The disease caused by OROV is an emerging, underdiagnosed infection that requires further research to determine its virulence, pathogenesis, host range and vectors involved in the urban and sylvatic cycles as well as identifying new genotypes to implement sensitive and specific diagnostic tools that can be applied to endemic regions.

Although malaria is the most important cause, other pathogens such as Dengue (DENV), Leptospira and recently, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have gained importance. In Colombia, few studies aimed to identify the etiology of AUFI. Most of them performed in Apartado and Villeta municipalities, identifying the active circulation of several pathogens. Thus, we conducted a cross-sectional study in these municipalities to characterize the etiologies of AUFI during COVID-19 pandemic., Methods: An active surveillance was conducted between September and December 2021 in local hospitals of Apartado and Villeta municipalities. Febrile patients were enrolled after voluntarily agreeing to participate in the study. Ten different etiologies were evaluated through direct, serological, molecular and rapid diagnostic methods., Results: In Apartado a confirmed etiology was found in 60% of subjects, DENV (25%) being the most frequent, followed by leptospirosis (16.7%), malaria (10%), COVID-19 (8.3%), spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsiosis (6.7%) and Chikungunya (1.7%). In Villeta, a specific etiology was confirmed in 55.4% of patients, of which SFG rickettsiosis (39.3%) was the most frequent, followed by leptospirosis (21.4%), DENV (3.6%) and malaria (1.8%). No cases due to Mayaro, Yellow Fever, Oropouche and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis viruses were detected., Conclusion: We confirm the relevance of dengue fever, leptospirosis, SFG rickettsiosis, COVID-19 and malaria as causes of AUFI in the municipality of Apartado, and highlight the great importance of SFG rickettsiosis as the main cause of AUFI in the municipality of Villeta.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Silva-Ramos Carlos Ramiro; Gil-Mora Juliana; Serna-Rivera Cristian C; Martinez Diaz; Heidy C; Restrepo-Lopez Nicaela; Agudelo-Florez Piedad; Arboleda Margarita; Diaz Francisco J; Faccini-Martinez Alvaro A; Hidalgo Marylin; Melby Peter C; Aguilar Patricia V; Cabada Miguel M; Tobon-Castano Alberto; Rodas Juan David; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Silva-Ramos Carlos Ramiro, Gil-Mora Juliana, Serna-Rivera Cristian C, Martinez Diaz, Heidy C, Restrepo-Lopez Nicaela, Agudelo-Florez Piedad, Arboleda Margarita, Diaz Francisco J, Faccini-Martinez Alvaro A, Hidalgo Marylin, Melby Peter C, Aguilar Patricia V, Cabada Miguel M, Tobon-Castano Alberto, and Rodas Juan David (2023) Etiological characterization of acute undifferentiated febrile illness in Apartado and Villeta municipalities, Colombia, during COVID-19 pandemic.

First isolated from a forest worker in Trinidad and Tobago in 1955, the arbovirus OROV has since been detected throughout the Amazon basin with an estimated 500,000 human infections over 60 years. Like other members of the family Peribunyaviridae, the viral genome exists as 3 single-stranded negative-sense RNA segments. The medium-sized segment encodes a viral glycoprotein complex (GPC) that is proteolytically processed into two viral envelope proteins, Gn and Gc, responsible for attachment and membrane fusion. There are no therapeutics or vaccines to combat OROV infection, and we have little understanding of protective immunity to infection. Here, we generated a replication competent chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), in which the endogenous glycoprotein was replaced by the GPC of OROV. Serum from mice immunized by intramuscular injection with VSV-OROV specifically neutralized wild-type OROV, and using peptide arrays we mapped multiple epitopes within an N-terminal variable region of Gc recognized by the immune sera. VSV-OROV lacking this variable region of Gc was also immunogenic in mice producing neutralizing sera that recognize additional regions of Gc. Challenge of both sets of immunized mice with wild-type OROV shows that the VSV-OROV chimeras reduce wild-type viral infection and suggest that antibodies that recognize the variable N terminus of Gc afford less protection than those that target more conserved regions of Gc. IMPORTANCE Oropouche virus (OROV), an orthobunyavirus found in Central and South America, is an emerging public health challenge that causes debilitating febrile illness. OROV is transmitted by arthropods, and increasing mobilization has the potential to significantly increase the spread of OROV globally. Despite this, no therapeutics or vaccines have been developed to combat infection. Using vesicular stomatitis (VSV) as a backbone, we developed a chimeric virus bearing the OROV glycoproteins (VSV-OROV) and tested its ability to elicit a neutralizing antibody response. Our results demonstrate that VSV-OROV produces a strong neutralizing antibody response that is at least partially targeted to the N-terminal region of Gc. Importantly, vaccination with VSV-OROV reduces viral loads in mice challenged with wild-type virus. These data provide novel evidence that targeting the OROV glycoproteins may be an effective vaccination strategy to combat OROV infection.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Stubbs Sarah Hulsey; Cornejo Pontelli; Marjorie; Mishra Nischay; Zhou Changhong; de Paula Souza Juliano; Mendes Viana Rosa Maria; Lipkin W Ian; Knipe David M; Arruda Eurico; Whelan Sean P.

From 390 inhabitants included in the first phase of serologic survey (August 1999), only 190 provided a second serum sample, after the use of 17D vaccine (January 2000). Among first phase samples, the frequency of HI antibodies was: 17D (27.2%); Ilheus (5.9%); Mayaro (5.4%); Caraparu (4.9%); Dengue-2 (4.1%); Oropouche (2.3%); and Dengue-1 (0.3%). In the second study phase, the serologic conversion to YF reached 89.7% among previously negative persons. Serologic conversions were also observed to Ilheus (6.2%); Dengue-3 (3.2%); Mayaro (1.1%); and Oropouche (1.1%) viruses. In conclusion, considering the high YF antibody rate after vaccination, the risk of urban yellow fever seems insignificant, although the lower prevalence of HI antibodies to dengue viruses, is of concern and inhabitants are under high risk of dengue outbreaks, especially to DEN-3 recently introduced in Brazil, as was observed in 2000 and 2001 with DEN-1 and DEN-2.","Comments":"BE removed link to pdf: https://dx.doi.org/10.1590/s0037-86822004000100001","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tavares-Neto Jose; Freitas-Carvalho Juliano; Nunes Marcio Roberto Teixeira; Rocha Grace; Rodrigues Sueli Guerreiro; Damasceno Edilandio; Darub Recleides; Viana Sebastiao; Vasconcelos Pedro Fernando da Costa; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"*Antibodies, Viral/bl [Blood]\r\nAntibodies, Viral/im [Immunology]\r\nArboviruses/cl [Classification]\r\n*Arboviruses/im [Immunology]\r\nBrazil/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nDengue/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nDengue/im [Immunology]\r\nDengue Virus/im [Immunology]\r\nFemale\r\nHemagglutination Inhibition Tests\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nSeroepidemiologic Studies\r\nYellow Fever/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nYellow Fever/im [Immunology]\r\n*Yellow Fever Vaccine/im [Immunology]","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tavares-Neto Jose, Freitas-Carvalho Juliano, Nunes Marcio Roberto Teixeira, Rocha Grace, Rodrigues Sueli Guerreiro, Damasceno Edilandio, Darub Recleides, Viana Sebastiao, and Vasconcelos Pedro Fernando da Costa (2004) Serologic survey for yellow fever and other arboviruses among inhabitants of Rio Branco, Brazil, before and three months after receiving the yellow fever 17D vaccine.

Brazil has been particularly affected, reporting a novel reassortant lineage of the Oropouche virus (OROV) and expansion to previously non-endemic areas beyond the Amazon Basin. Utilising phylogeographic approaches, we reveal a multi-scale expansion process with both short and long-distance dispersal events, and diffusion velocities in line with human-mediated jumps. We identify forest cover, banana and cocoa cultivation, temperature, and human population density as key environmental factors associated with OROV range expansion. Using ecological niche modelling, we show that OROV circulated in areas of enhanced ecological suitability immediately preceding its explosive epidemic expansion in the Amazon. This likely resulted from the virus being introduced into simultaneously densely populated and environmentally favourable regions in the Amazon, such as Manaus, leading to an amplified epidemic and spread beyond the Amazon. Our study provides valuable insights into the dispersal and ecological dynamics of OROV, highlighting the role of human mobility in colonisation of new areas, and raising concern over high viral suitability along the Brazilian coast.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tegally Houriiyah; Dellicour Simon; Poongavanan Jenicca; Mavian Carla; Dor Graeme; Fonseca Vagner; Tagliamonte Massimiliano S; Dunaiski Marcel; Moir Monika; Wilkinson Eduan; de Albuquerque Carlos Frederico Campelo; Frutuoso Livia C.

Among the Brazilian arboviruses, Mayaro virus, Dengue virus (DENV), Yellow Fever virus, Rocio virus, Saint Louis Encephalitis virus (SLEV), and Oropouche virus are responsible for most of human cases. All these arboviruses usually produce undistinguishable acute febrile illness, especially in the acute phase of infection. In this study we investigated the presence of arboviruses in sera of 519 patients presenting acute febrile illness, during a dengue outbreak in Sao Jose do Rio Preto City (Sao Paulo, Brazil). A multiplex-nested RT-polymerase chain reaction assay was applied to detect and identify the main Brazilian arboviruses (Flavivirus, Alphavirus, and Orthobunyavirus genera). The molecular analysis showed that 365 samples were positive to DENV-3, 5 to DENV-2, and 8 to SLEV. Among the positive samples, one coinfection was detected between DENV-2 and DENV-3. The phylogenetic analysis of the SLEV envelope gene indicated that the virus circulating in city is related to lineage V strains. These results indicated that during that large DENV-3 outbreak in 2006, different arboviruses cocirculated causing human disease. Thus, it is necessary to have an efficient surveillance system to control the dissemination of these arboviruses in the population.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Terzian Ana Carolina Bernardes; Mondini Adriano; Bronzoni Roberta Vieira de Moraes; Drumond Betania Paiva; Ferro Bianca Piovezan; Cabrera Eliana Marcia Sotello; Figueiredo Luis Tadeu Moraes; Chiaravalloti-Neto Francisco; Nogueira Mauricio Lacerda; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Aedes/vi [Virology]\r\nAmino Acid Sequence\r\nAnimals\r\n*Arboviruses/ge [Genetics]\r\nArboviruses/ip [Isolation & Purification]\r\nBase Sequence\r\nBrazil/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nCell Line\r\nCoinfection\r\n*Dengue/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nDengue/vi [Virology]\r\n*Dengue Virus/ge [Genetics]\r\nDengue Virus/ip [Isolation & Purification]\r\nDisease Outbreaks\r\n*Encephalitis Virus, St. Louis/ge [Genetics]\r\nEncephalitis Virus, St. Louis/ip [Isolation & Purification]\r\n*Encephalitis, St. Louis/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nEncephalitis, St. Louis/vi [Virology]\r\nHumans\r\nMice\r\nMolecular Sequence Data\r\nMultiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction\r\nPhylogeny\r\nPublic Health\r\n*RNA, Viral/bl [Blood]\r\nSequence Alignment\r\nSequence Analysis, DNA\r\nViral Envelope Proteins/ge [Genetics]","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Terzian Ana Carolina Bernardes, Mondini Adriano, Bronzoni Roberta Vieira de Moraes, Drumond Betania Paiva, Ferro Bianca Piovezan, Cabrera Eliana Marcia Sotello, Figueiredo Luis Tadeu Moraes, Chiaravalloti-Neto Francisco, and Nogueira Mauricio Lacerda (2011) Detection of Saint Louis encephalitis virus in dengue-suspected cases during a dengue 3 outbreak.

OROV was first isolated in 1955, and since then, it has been known to cause recurring outbreaks of a dengue-like illness in the Amazonian regions of Brazil. OROV, however, remains one of the most poorly understood emerging viral zoonoses. Here we describe the successful recovery of infectious OROV entirely from cDNA copies of its genome and generation of OROV mutant viruses lacking either the NSm or the NSs coding region. Characterization of the recombinant viruses carried out in vitro demonstrated that the NSs protein of OROV is an interferon (IFN) antagonist as in other NSs-encoding bunyaviruses. Additionally, we demonstrate the importance of the nine C-terminal amino acids of OROV NSs in IFN antagonistic activity. OROV was also found to be sensitive to IFN-alpha when cells were pretreated; however, the virus was still capable of replicating at doses as high as 10,000 U/ml of IFN-alpha, in contrast to the family prototype BUNV. We found that OROV lacking the NSm protein displayed characteristics similar to those of the wild-type virus, suggesting that the NSm protein is dispensable for virus replication in the mammalian and mosquito cell lines that were tested., IMPORTANCE: Oropouche virus (OROV) is a public health threat in Central and South America, where it causes periodic outbreaks of dengue-like illness. In Brazil, OROV is the second most frequent cause of arboviral febrile illness after dengue virus, and with the current rates of urban expansion, more cases of this emerging viral zoonosis could occur. To better understand the molecular biology of OROV, we have successfully rescued the virus along with mutants. We have established that the C terminus of the NSs protein is important in interferon antagonism and that the NSm protein is dispensable for virus replication in cell culture. The tools described in this paper are important in terms of understanding this important yet neglected human pathogen. Copyright &#xa9; 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

We also report the complete genome sequences of two OROV reassortants isolatd from two marmosets in Minas Gerais state, south-east Brazil, in 2012 that contained a novel M genome segment. Interestingly, all 10 isolates possessed a 947 nt S segment that lacked 11 residues in the S-segment 3' UTR compared with the recently redetermined Brazilian prototype OROV strain BeAn19991.

In 2024, Oropouche cases sharply increased in several countries of the Americas, including Bolivia. Here, we performed a genomic study to investigate the origin and spread of OROV in the Bolivian Amazon region. Methods Full-length OROV genomes from 34 positive samples collected in the three affected Bolivian departments during 2024 were sequenced using an amplicon-based approach. Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analyses of separate viral segments were conducted to identify the responsible viral lineage. Bayesian phylogeographic analysis of concatenated viral segments was used to reconstruct the viral spatiotemporal dispersion pattern within the country. Findings Epidemiological data shows that the first OROV-positive cases in 2024 in Bolivia were reported in samples collected from the Pando department during mid-January, and the peak of OROV-positive cases occurred in mid-April. The phylogenetic analysis of OROV genomes revealed that all cases detected in Bolivia belong to the novel reassortant OROV clade that drove the recent epidemic in Brazil. Our phylogeographic analysis detected at least two exportation events of OROV from the Brazilian state of Acre to the Bolivian municipalities of Guayaramerín and Riberalta, both located in the Beni department, with subsequent dissemination to municipalities of Pando and La Paz departments. Viral introductions probably occurred between early October and early November 2023, thus indicating a lag of about three months between OROV introduction and detection in Bolivia. Interpretation Our findings confirm that OROV spread at least twice from the western Brazilian Amazon to the neighboring Bolivian department of Beni in late 2023, successfully establishing regional transmission chains. The introduction and spread of OROV in Bolivia coincides with the Amazonian rainy season, from November to April, a period likely marked by an increase in vector abundance. These findings underscore the critical need for active OROV surveillance across the cross-border Amazonian region between Brazil and Bolivia. They also confirm the potential for sustained OROV transmission within the Bolivian Amazon, highlighting the importance of preparedness for future outbreaks.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Valdez Joel Alejandro Chuquimia; Arantes Ighor; Martínez Sebastián Sasías; Mendoza Cleidy Orellana; Loayza Nelly Mendoza; Marquina Jhonatan D; Laura Helen Castillo; Kacic Roxana Salamanca; Morales Maya Xochitl Espinoza; Gresh Lionel; Gómez Mariela Martínez; Méndez-Rico Jairo; Bello Gonzalo; Naveca Felipe Gomes; Mafayle Leidy Roxana Loayza; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Valdez Joel Alejandro Chuquimia, Arantes Ighor, Martínez Sebastián Sasías, Mendoza Cleidy Orellana, Loayza Nelly Mendoza, Marquina Jhonatan D, Laura Helen Castillo, Kacic Roxana Salamanca, Morales Maya Xochitl Espinoza, Gresh Lionel, Gómez Mariela Martínez, Méndez-Rico Jairo, Bello Gonzalo, Naveca Felipe Gomes, and Mafayle Leidy Roxana Loayza (2024) Genomic characterization, origin, and local transmission of Oropouche Virus in Bolivia in 2024. medRxiv , 2024.12.23.24319382"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":17036613,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":17036601,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":17036565,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"Outcomes":[],"ItemId":109133687,"Title":"Occurrence of arboviruses belonging to the C-, Bunyamwera and Guama groups, and of Oropouche, Junin, Tacaiuma and Kwatta viruses in man in the province of Brokopondo, Surinam: a serological survey","ParentTitle":"Tropical and geographical medicine","ShortTitle":"van Tongeren (1967)","DateCreated":"10/02/2025","CreatedBy":"Matthew Bosworth","DateEdited":"13/05/2025","EditedBy":"Beti Evans","Year":"1967","Month":"","StandardNumber":"0041-3232","City":"","Country":"","Publisher":"","Institution":"","Volume":"19","Pages":"309-25","Edition":"","Issue":"4","Availability":"","URL":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/5585978/","OldItemId":"1407","Abstract":"","Comments":"BE removed the url: http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med1&NEWS=N&AN=5585978","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"van Tongeren H A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAge Factors\r\nAged\r\n*Antibodies/an [Analysis]\r\n*Arbovirus Infections/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nChild\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNeutralization Tests\r\nSex Factors\r\nSuriname\r\nVirus Cultivation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"van Tongeren H A (1967) Occurrence of arboviruses belonging to the C-, Bunyamwera and Guama groups, and of Oropouche, Junin, Tacaiuma and Kwatta viruses in man in the province of Brokopondo, Surinam: a serological survey.

There is currently very limited understanding on what determines the host species range of these pathogens. In this study we discovered that BST-2/tetherin restricts orthobunyavirus replication in a host-specific manner. We show that viruses with human tropism (Oropouche virus and La Crosse virus) are restricted by sheep BST-2 but not by the human orthologue, while viruses with ruminant tropism (Schmallenberg virus and others) are restricted by human BST-2 but not by the sheep orthologue. We also show that BST-2 blocks orthobunyaviruses replication by reducing the amount of envelope glycoprotein into viral particles egressing from infected cells. This is the first study identifying a restriction factor that correlates with species susceptibility to orthobunyavirus infection. This work provides insight to help us dissect the adaptive changes that bunyaviruses require to cross the species barrier and emerge into new species. Copyright &#xa9; 2017 The Authors.

Recurrence of symptoms was reported in 56% of sick people. Mice inoculated with 3624 Culicoides paraensis (Ceratopogonidae) and 1970 Culex (Cux.) quinquefasciatus (Culicidae) collected in Porto Franco resulted in one single isolation of ORO virus, from the Culicoides. These are the first confirmed cases of ORO infection in Maranhão and Goiás states.","Comments":"BE replaced URL to article: http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&nrm=iso&lng=pt&tlng=pt&pid=S0036-46651989000400011 with pubmed link","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Vasconcelos Pedro Fernando da Costa; Rosa Jorge Fernando Soares Travassos da; Guerreiro Sueli Corrêa; Dégallier Nicolas; Rosa Elizabeth Salbé Travassos da; Rosa Amélia Paes de Andrade Travassos da; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Vasconcelos Pedro Fernando da Costa, Rosa Jorge Fernando Soares Travassos da, Guerreiro Sueli Corrêa, Dégallier Nicolas, Rosa Elizabeth Salbé Travassos da, and Rosa Amélia Paes de Andrade Travassos da (1989) 1st register of an epidemic caused by Oropouche virus in the states of Maranhão and Goiás, Brazil.

Serology (IgM-ELISA and hemagglutination-inhibition [HI]), virus isolation, RT-PCR and real-time-PCR were used to confirm Oropouche virus (OROV) as responsible for the febrile outbreaks., RESULTS: Real-time-PCR showed high titers of OROV in acute-phase serum samples from febrile patients. From 113 of 119 acutely febrile patients with paired serum samples, OROV infections was confirmed by serologic conversion (n=76) or high titers (n=37) for both HI and IgM-ELISA. Patients had a febrile disease characterized by headache, chills, dizziness, photophobia, myalgia, nausea, and vomiting. Females and children under 15 years of age were most affected. Nucleotide sequencing of six OROV isolates identified that genotype II was associated with the human disease epidemic., CONCLUSIONS: Oropouche fever, which has re-emerged in the Bragantina region in eastern Amazon 26 years after the last epidemic, is caused by genotype II, a lineage previously found only in Peru and western Brazil.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Vasconcelos Helena B; Azevedo Raimunda S.

To describe the molecular epidemiology of OROV, we analyzed the entire N gene sequences (small RNA) of 66 strains and 35 partial Gn (medium RNA) and large RNA gene sequences. Distinct patterns of OROV strain clustered according to N, Gn, and large gene sequences, which suggests that each RNA segment had a different evolutionary history and that the classification in genotypes must consider the genetic information for all genetic segments. Finally, time-scale analysis based on the N gene showed that OROV emerged in Brazil =223 years ago and that genotype I (based on N gene data) was responsible for the emergence of all other genotypes and for virus dispersal.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Vasconcelos Helena Baldez; Nunes Marcio R.

In dengue-endemic areas illness due to other arboviruses have been misdiagnosed as dengue based only on clinical-epidemiological data. In this study we investigated the presence of Brazilian arboviruses in sera of 200 patients presenting acute febrile illness, during a dengue outbreak in Sinop, MT, Brazil. The results showed that 38 samples were positive to Dengue virus (DENV) type 1, two samples to DENV type 4, and six to Mayaro virus. These results indicate that arboviruses others than DENV are circulating in Sinop and the surrounding region, which are going undiagnosed. In addition, molecular and evolutionary analyses indicate that two MAYV genotypes are co-circulating in Mato Grosso, Brazil. Thus, a strong surveillance program must be implemented to evaluate and monitor the distribution and the true importance of non-dengue arboviruses in the etiology of acute febrile illnesses.

To date nucleotide sequence data has been obtained for three serogroups, Bunyamwera, California and Simbu, based on analysis of the small (S) RNA segment. In comparison, there is only nucleotide sequence data for the large and medium (M) RNA segments for members of the Bunyamwera and California serogroups. In this paper we report the nucleotide sequence of the M RNA of Oropouche (ORO) virus, a member of the Simbu serogroup. The M RNA was 4396 nucleotides in length with G1, G2 and NSm proteins similar in size to those reported for members of the Bunyamwera and California serogroups. However, there was limited nucleotide (50-52%) and amino acid (30-32%) homology between ORO virus M RNA and those of published members of the other two serogroups. The Bunyamwera and California serogroups are more closely related to each other than the Simbu serogroup virus Oropouche. These data were consistent with that previously reported for the S RNA (Saeed et al., 2000. J. Gen. Virol. 81, 743-748). It has been noted previously that three of four potential N-linked glycosylation sites of the Bunayamwera and California serogroups are conserved in G1 and G2 proteins. In contrast, ORO virus was found to have only three potential N-linked glycosylation sites of which only one, in G1, was conserved with members of the other two serogroups. Comparison of M RNA sequences of different strains of ORO virus revealed genetic variation consistent with that reported previously for the S RNA.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wang H; Beasley D W; Li L; Holbrook M R; Barrett A D; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Amino Acid Sequence\r\nBunyamwera virus/ch [Chemistry]\r\n*Bunyamwera virus/ge [Genetics]\r\nEncephalitis Virus, California/ch [Chemistry]\r\n*Encephalitis Virus, California/ge [Genetics]\r\nGenetic Variation\r\nMolecular Sequence Data\r\n*RNA, Viral/ge [Genetics]\r\nSequence Alignment\r\nSequence Analysis, DNA\r\nSimbu virus/ch [Chemistry]\r\n*Simbu virus/ge [Genetics]\r\nViral Nonstructural Proteins/ch [Chemistry]\r\n*Viral Nonstructural Proteins/ge [Genetics]","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wang H, Beasley D W, Li L, Holbrook M R, and Barrett A D (2001) Nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of the medium RNA segment of Oropouche, a Simbu serogroup virus: comparison with the middle RNA of Bunyamwera and California serogroup viruses.

On June 14-16, 1994, clinical data and blood samples were obtained from eight soldiers with a febrile illness, and from 26 others who had a history of febrile illness during the past three months. A follow-up blood sample was obtained 107 days later from four of the febrile and seven of the afebrile soldiers. Serum samples were tested for dengue (DEN), Oropouche (ORO), and Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) IgM and IgG antibodies by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Virus isolation was performed by inoculation of newborn mice and Vero cell cultures. Viral isolates were identified by immunofluorescence, ELISA, and nucleotide sequencing. A VEE virus infection was confirmed in three of the eight febrile soldiers, two by virus isolation, and one by serology. Antigenic analysis indicated that one of the virus isolates was similar to VEE subtype I, variety ID, viruses previously isolated in Colombia and Venezuela. Nucleotide sequence data showed that both viral isolates were identical to one another and closely related to VEE ID viruses previously isolated in Peru, Colombia, and Venezuela. Serologic results showed that two of 26 afebrile soldiers had IgM antibody to VEE and four had IgG antibody to VEE; two febrile soldiers had IgG antibody in their first serum samples. Oropouche-specific IgM antibody was detected in one of the eight febrile and five of the afebrile soldiers, and 18 of the 34 soldiers had low titers of ORO IgG antibody titers, which did not meet the diagnostic criteria for confirmed cases. All soldiers were negative for DEN IgM antibody, and 10 had flavivirus IgG antibody that reacted with DEN antigens. These data indicated that VEE ID virus was one of the causes of illness among Peruvians soldiers and that this was the first association of this VEE subtype with human disease in Peru.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Watts D M; Lavera V; Callahan J; Rossi C; Oberste M S; Roehrig J T; Cropp C B; Karabatsos N; Smith J F; Gubler D J; Wooster M T; Nelson W M; Hayes C G; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAnimals\r\nAntibodies, Viral/bl [Blood]\r\n*Bunyaviridae Infections/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nBunyaviridae Infections/vi [Virology]\r\n*Disease Outbreaks\r\nEncephalitis Virus, Venezuelan Equine/im [Immunology]\r\nEncephalitis Virus, Venezuelan Equine/ip [Isolation & Purification]\r\n*Encephalomyelitis, Venezuelan Equine/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nEncephalomyelitis, Venezuelan Equine/vi [Virology]\r\nHumans\r\nImmunoglobulin G/bl [Blood]\r\nImmunoglobulin M/bl [Blood]\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nOrthobunyavirus\r\nPeru/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nSeroepidemiologic Studies\r\nSimbu virus/im [Immunology]\r\nSimbu virus/ip [Isolation & Purification]","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Watts D M, Lavera V, Callahan J, Rossi C, Oberste M S, Roehrig J T, Cropp C B, Karabatsos N, Smith J F, Gubler D J, Wooster M T, Nelson W M, and Hayes C G (1997) Venezuelan equine encephalitis and Oropouche virus infections among Peruvian army troops in the Amazon region of Peru.

Antibody prevalence increased with age, and subjects who were seropositive were significantly (P = 0.001) older (mean = 33 years) than the seronegative subjects (mean = 15 years). Multivariate analysis revealed that only age, urban and forest residence, and occupation as a farmer or housekeeper remained significantly associated with seropositivity. Seroconversion data for the same populations one year later demonstrated evidence of ORO viral infection among 28% of the residents in the rural community and 2% or less in the forest and urban communities. Oropouche virus infection was significantly associated with older age (P = 0.04) in the rural community (P < 0.001). These data support prior evidence of ORO viral infection among residents of Iquitos and surrounding villages and suggest that transmission of this virus occurs continuously in the population of this area of the Amazon basin.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Watts D M; Phillips I; Callahan J D; Griebenow W; Hyams K C; Hayes C G; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAnalysis of Variance\r\n*Antibodies, Viral/bl [Blood]\r\n*Bunyaviridae Infections/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nBunyaviridae Infections/tm [Transmission]\r\nChild\r\nChild, Preschool\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nIncidence\r\nInfant\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMultivariate Analysis\r\nPeru/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nPrevalence\r\nRisk Factors\r\nRural Population\r\nSeroepidemiologic Studies\r\n*Simbu virus/im [Immunology]\r\nUrban Population","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Watts D M, Phillips I, Callahan J D, Griebenow W, Hyams K C, and Hayes C G (1997) Oropouche virus transmission in the Amazon River basin of Peru.

Epidemiological and clinical data as well as blood samples were obtained from consenting patients at hospitals, health clinics and private residences. Samples were tested for arboviruses in cell cultures and for IgM and IgG antibodies by ELISA. Blood smears were examined for malaria, and sera were tested for antibodies to Leptospira spp. by ELISA and microscopic agglutination. Among 6,607 febrile patients studied, dengue viruses caused 14.6% of the cases, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus caused 2.5%, Oropouche virus 1.0%, Mayaro virus 0.4%, and other arboviruses caused 0.2% of the cases. Also, 22.9% of 4,844 patients tested were positive for malaria, and of 400 samples tested, 9% had evidence of acute leptospirosis. Although the study was not designed to assess the importance of these pathogens as a cause of human morbidity in the total population, these results indicate that arboviruses, leptospirosis, and malaria were the cause of approximately 50% of the febrile cases. Although the arboviruses that were diagnosed can produce asymptomatic infections, our findings increased the overall understanding of the relative health burden of these infections, as well as baseline knowledge needed for designing and implementing further studies to better assess the health impact and threat of these pathogens in the Amazon Basin of Peru.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Watts Douglas M; Russell Kevin L; Wooster Mark T; Sharp Trueman W; Morrison Amy C; Kochel Tad J; Bautista Christian T; Block Karla; Guevara Carolina; Aguilar Patricia; Palermo Pedro M; Calampa Carlos; Porter Kevin R; Hayes Curtis G; Weaver Scott C; de Rosa Amelia Travassos; Vinetz Joseph M; Shope Robert E; Gotuzzo Eduardo; Guzman Hilda; Tesh Robert B; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Humans\r\nPeru/ep [Epidemiology]\r\nRivers\r\n*Encephalitis Virus, Venezuelan Equine\r\n*Arboviruses\r\nLeptospirosis/ep [Epidemiology]\r\n*Leptospirosis\r\nFever/ep [Epidemiology]\r\n*Malaria","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Watts Douglas M, Russell Kevin L, Wooster Mark T, Sharp Trueman W, Morrison Amy C, Kochel Tad J, Bautista Christian T, Block Karla, Guevara Carolina, Aguilar Patricia, Palermo Pedro M, Calampa Carlos, Porter Kevin R, Hayes Curtis G, Weaver Scott C, de Rosa Amelia Travassos, Vinetz Joseph M, Shope Robert E, Gotuzzo Eduardo, Guzman Hilda, and Tesh Robert B (2022) Etiologies of Acute Undifferentiated Febrile Illnesses in and near Iquitos from 1993 to 1999 in the Amazon River Basin of Peru.

We compared the performances of these assays on three currently available cyclers (ABI-PRISM 7700, LightCycler, and SmartCycler). The assay for Oropouche virus (OROV) was tested using sera collected from days 1 to 5 after onset of OROV disease and was found to be greatly superior to an established nested PCR system. A mean copy number of 1.31 x 10(7) OROV RNA/ml of serum was detected. Diagnostic RNA detection can be used as early as day 1 after onset of OROV disease. The use of a mobile SmartCycler and a hands-on time of less than 3 h could help to intensify outbreak surveillance and control, especially in field studies.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Weidmann Manfred; Rudaz Veronique; Nunes Marcio R.

Metagenomic sequencing of the patient samples provided OROV genome coverage ranging from 68-99%. The additional cases formed a single phylogenetic cluster together with the initial case.

Despite the growing importance of the virus, there is still a lack of knowledge regarding its evolutionary origins, host interactions. To effectively control OROV, it is essential to identify sentinel host species and monitor both viral carriage and mutations. Methods: To identify viruses with close evolutionary relationships, BLAST searches were conducted on the NCBI database using the reference sequences of OROV's S, M, and L segments. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted for each segment using MEGA7.0. Potential reassortment or recombination events were evaluated using RDP4 and SimPlot. As the M segment lacked identifiable parent sequences in the existing database, it was divided into 10-20 fragments. Each fragment was then subjected to online distant BLAST searches with adjusted parameters. Similar searches were conducted on both the M segment of OROV and the conserved S segment, which is present in both OROV and OROV-like viruses. The BLAST results were manually classified and counted according to related species. Findings: Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the M segments of two OROV-like viruses, Perdoes virus (PD) and Iquitos virus (IQ), did not cluster with OROVs. Reassortment and recombination analyses confirmed this feature. Nevertheless, no closely related parental sequences were identified in the existing databases. Online distant BLAST returned a number of non-viral hits related to cellular organisms, including both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The eukaryotic hits encompassed three kingdoms-fungi, plants, and animals-and included 13 phyla. As animal viruses, the hits included eight zoonotic phyla, 16 classes, and 27 orders. In particular, with regard to PD, 19.57% (9/46) of the identified zoonotic hits related to Lepidoptera, whereas only 6.52% (3/46) were derived from Diptera. In the case of IQ, the contribution of Lepidoptera to the total number of zoonotic hits was 31.82% (21/66), in comparison to a mere 1.52% (1/66) from Diptera. The fragments derived from Lepidoptera exhibited the highest degree of identity with the corresponding viral sequences, thereby providing further support for the chimeric nature of the M segments in these OROV-like viruses. A similar pattern of chimeric features was observed in the M segment of OROV, with Lepidoptera accounting for 40.90% (9/22) of the identified zoonotic hits, while Diptera accounted for only 4.54% (1/22). In the more conserved S segment of OROV, 83 zoonotic hits were identified across 13 classes and 20 orders, with Lepidoptera and Diptera representing 24.10% (20/83) and 12.05% (10/83), respectively. The results of this analysis indicate a stronger genomic association with Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) than with the traditionally implicated Diptera (mosquitoes and midges). Interpretation: Our findings highlight the intricate evolutionary dynamics of OROV and OROV-like viruses, with substantial implications for comprehending their emergence, host shifts, and prospective zoonotic transmission. Lepidopteran insects appear to play a crucial role in the ecological adaptation and evolution of these viruses, acting as mixing vessels facilitate virus spread across different insect species and, on occasion, to humans. These insights underscore the importance of Lepidoptera in shaping orthobunyaviruses on their evolutionary trajectories. Our study contributes to a broader understanding of virus evolution, suggesting that future surveillance and control strategies for OROV-related pathogens should consider the role of arthropod vectors, particularly in regions with high biodiversity, such as the Amazon Basin, where the diversity of Lepidoptera species is notably high.
